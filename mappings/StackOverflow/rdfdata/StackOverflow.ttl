And we laugh &ndash; all the time. You'll get the opportunity to work at an institution pushing the boundaries of open data transparency, while collaborating with some of the industry&rsquo;s brightest engineers and data scientists to devise, nurture, and implement cutting-edge solutions to continuously evolving engineering obstacles.</p><br /><p><strong>About the Position</strong><br>Willy Wonka said &ldquo;We are the dreamers of dreams.&rdquo; Well, FiscalNote front-end engineers are the architects that make our open data dreams come true. Wild ambition isn&rsquo;t lacking at FiscalNote, and only the most talented can visualize open-data products that have never been built before. Our front-end engineers love what they do, and they are on a mission to continuously improve upon and build the most beautiful and useful user interfaces the open data world has ever seen.</p><br /><p><strong>About You</strong><br>Creative. Ambitious. Communicative. Driven. &nbsp;You yearn to exercise your abilities in a greater capacity than on a tiny feature of a much larger product. Lending your talents across our entire stack, you not only love sharing your savvy with the team, but also crave the opportunity to absorb any and all knowledge from our hyper-collaborative environment. Your appreciation (bordering on obsession) for clean code and attention to detail have helped you shine brightly at previous positions. You&rsquo;re tickled by the idea of implementing inventive uses of older technologies, but even more revved at the idea of leveraging the most modern front-end tools, frameworks, and languages. Most of all, though, you live to engineer creative interfaces that take the user experience to a whole new level.</p><br /><p><strong>You Have</strong><br>- 2+ years of industry experience programming in JavaScript<br>- Expertise with HTML5 and CSS3<br>- Expertise with jQuery<br>- Knowledge of algorithms, data structures and Object Oriented programming<br>- Knowledge of and experience with JavaScript MV* frameworks. Ember.js is highly recommended.<br>- Undergraduate and/or graduate degree in engineering, computer science, or related technical field (&lt;i&gt;Preferred&lt;/i&gt;)<br>- Proficient with Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, or related design software (&lt;i&gt;Preferred&lt;/i&gt;)<br>- UI/UX design experience (&lt;i&gt;Ideal&lt;/i&gt;)</p><br /><p>In becoming a FiscalNoter, you&rsquo;ll enjoy a plethora of benefits that you would expect at both an established company and at a startup. More importantly, though, is the opportunity to develop software that impacts real decisions -- decisions that substantially affect governing in the US and abroad. You will hone your engineering skills among peers just as motivated and skilled as you are, and in the process, develop a tight-knit camaraderie that will transcend simple software development.</p>" ;

Whatever it is going to be,&nbsp;it will be at the very heart of what Xanadu does and crucial to its success.</p><br /><p>In summary, we offer:<br>&nbsp; - Highly intellectual and competitive atmosphere<br>&nbsp; - No sales pitches (we don't have customers - we code for ourselves, to our specs, to solve our problems, on our timeline)<br>&nbsp; - Ability to use advanced mathematical modelling skills<br>&nbsp; - Ability to write robust and highly efficient code, where both make a tremendous difference<br>&nbsp; - English speaking work environment<br>&nbsp; - Free food<br>&nbsp; - Social activities<br>&nbsp; - Nice office space<br>&nbsp; - Very competitive salaries (salaries are negotiable and depend on experience - for fresh graduates&nbsp;total remuneration starts at 36k&euro; excluding benefits)</p>" ;

Can you detect and prevent the invasion of bugs better than the Orkin man? &nbsp;If you answered yes to any/all of these, then you really need to be a Software Development Engineer in Test at Rackspace.</p><br /><p>With the largest OpenStack public cloud in the business and our commitment to provide our customers the best platform to continue changing the world, the life of an SDET at the Rack can be quite unique and rewarding. How is this possible? Easy&mdash;we help match your passions, birthday wishes, and Sherlock skills with the right opportunity to be GREAT. Here&rsquo;s a preview to get you started:</p><br /><p><strong>Pushing the Limits of the Cloud:<br></strong>OpenStack&hellip;heard of it? Yep we worked with NASA as founders so of course we have some of the most notable upstream contributors on the planet. Whether for our public or private cloud offerings, our Devs are pounding out code in Python, Ruby, Java or whatever&rsquo;s the next big thing at a break-neck pace. So when it comes to SDETs, we take pride in being true partners in excellence; not some robot or second-tier Dev whose only task is to cross off test cases from a checklist. Our SDETs have a tinker&rsquo;s mind with a natural curiosity to know where we are going and to anticipate the unexpected. Diversity drives innovation so our teams are dispersed across the globe&mdash;even working from their favorite Cheetos-stained gaming chair at home.</p><br /><p><strong>Internal Innovation:<br></strong>Ten data centers around the globe with several hundred thousand servers that all need to seamlessly interact like one of your LAN parties back in college. If you like HUGE environments then jump on into this playground. Our DevOps Engineers, Software Developers, and Infrastructure Engineers have to keep up with the demands of the industry that didn&rsquo;t exist, oh maybe 5 minutes ago. &nbsp;Our SDETs who partner with these teams are literally building their dreams to insure what&rsquo;s new today is built to withstand the strains of tomorrow. Bulletproof code&mdash;that&rsquo;s how we roll.</p><br /><p>This is NOT your uncle&rsquo;s Quality Engineering team where there was a lack of software development to accomplish testing and the job was just about manual button pushing. Are you ready to change the game doing what they said can&rsquo;t be done? Are you ready to automate bigger things better and faster? What are you waiting for? Click that apply button, talk with one of our talent specialists and get ready to jump on in to the best adventure you&rsquo;ve ever had.</p><br /><p>Still not convinced? Hear from the Rackers who do this day in and day out but still can&rsquo;t believe this is their job. <a title=\"QE at the Rack\" href=\"http://youtu.be/LhoEa7Ag8Xw\">QE at the Rack</a></p>" ;

    ns2:description "<p>Do you believe in the power of Open Source? Does contributing to the Open Source community WHILE working making you happier than an engineer who just found the ultimate gif? Is collaboration a key component to what makes you tick? If you answered yes to any/all of these, then you really need to be a Software Developer at Rackspace.</p><br /><p>With the largest OpenStack public cloud in the business and our commitment to build the best private cloud offering in the industry, the life of a dev at the Rack can be different but don&rsquo;t worry we will help match your skills, passions and birthday wishes with the right opportunity. Here&rsquo;s a preview to get you started:</p><br /><p><strong>Private Cloud:<br></strong>Rackspace has some of the most notable upstream OpenStack contributors on the planet. Duh&hellip;we co-founded the thing so of course we do and you will have the opportunity to do the same. Private cloud devs literally pound out Python code from all over the globe in one of our offices or from the comfort of their own home if they have shown superior abilities, yet don&rsquo;t worry we have the tools to keep you connected when you need to be. These teams manage, scale and optimize every aspect of the customer&rsquo;s environment including a little Ops work so be ready to own it like it&rsquo;s your own little baby.</p><br /><p><strong>Public Cloud:<br></strong>The largest OpenStack public cloud in the world just obviously means huge, large-scale, highly distributed customer environments that extend to many of our 10+ global data centers. Python, Ruby, PHP you name it. Teams are made up of specialists for each but they dabble in everything. Swiss Army code knives are just how we roll. This squad pulls in other devs from other business units, infrastructure engineers and quality engineering all to get the job done. No one fails alone because they are never left alone. Even as they push the bounds of big data or whatever comes out next they learn together and win together.</p><br /><p>What are you waiting for? Click that apply button, get a chance to talk with one of our talent specialists and get ready to jump on in to the best adventure you&rsquo;ve ever had.</p><br /><p>Still not convinced?

Exaptive is more than just a data analytics platform. It's a complete ecosystem for data science - that means it is comprised of a bunch of different pieces that all have to work together. There is the web-based development environment, the Xap Store, and the Cognitive Network. Each component introduces its own set of infrastructure requirements. In addition, we have a consulting branch of the business which sometimes needs infrastructure design decisions in response to unique custom client requirements.&nbsp;<br> <br> This position will be based in downtown OKC, but with the opportunity for travel to Exaptive's Boston and Vancouver locations. The position will have the opportunity to evolve into a role in which the person has an equity-stake in the company. The right person will be excited about the dynamic and fast-paced (aka stressful) environment of a startup and view that as a benefit, not a drawback. The startup environment is not for everyone, but for the person who is looking for that sort of life experience, the opportunity to help build something from the ground up where individual contributions make immediate and substantial impacts on the company as a whole can be extremely rewarding.&nbsp;<br> <br> Those interested can find out more about the company, and view some demo videos of our software in actionon our website: www.exaptive.com.

    ns2:description "<p>Exaptive, Inc is an MIT affiliated, fast-growing software startup that has offices in Oklahoma City, Boston and Vancouver, Canada. We are now expanding our Oklahoma City team.&nbsp;<br> <br> We are looking for entry-level programmers that have some formal computer science training, but are just starting their careers. You should know javascript and some javascript libraries like jQuery, D3, etc, and have an interest in data visualization, data science, and internet technologies. Most importantly, you should be hungry to build big, important applications that matter, and looking for projects to flex your newly developed coding muscles on.&nbsp;<br> <br> Experience with a variety of different internet technologies would be a bonus, but not necessary - we view this very much as a learn-on-the-job type position and as a result are valuing smarts, motivation and desire-to-learn over experience. These positions will be based in downtown OKC, but with the opportunity for travel to Exaptive's Boston and Vancouver locations. The position will have the opportunity to evolve into a role in which the person has an equity-stake in the company. The right person will be excited about the dynamic and fast-paced (aka stressful) environment of a startup and view that as a benefit, not a drawback. The startup environment is not for everyone, but for the person who is looking for that sort of life experience, the opportunity to help build something from the ground up where individual contributions make immediate and substantial impacts on the company as a whole can be extremely rewarding.&nbsp;<br> <br> Those interested can find out more about the company, and view some demo videos of our software in actionon our website: www.exaptive.com. We were featured on the front page of the Business Innovation section of The Boston Globe (http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2013/12/cambridge-based_exaptive_wants.html) and in Oklahoma City's The Journal Record (http://www.i2e.org/news/innovators-exaptive-inc/). Our Founder and CEO, Dave King, has been invited internationally to present our work. You can see a video of a presentation he recently gave to the Oklahoma Venture Forum about Exaptive's big-picture vision on our website.&nbsp;<br> <br> If you don't currently live in Oklahoma City, you should check out what this up-and-coming city has to offer: a burgeoning tech startup and creative sector, the largest food truck event in the nation, olympic rowing facilities, and a cost of living that can't be beat.

We try to see where the bleeding edge is, but live in the realm of reality and practicality.</li><br /><li><strong>Hack this site.</strong>&nbsp;Seriously. We're the type of people who think hackthissite.org is one of the coolest places on the internet, so everything we build has an eye to keeping things safe.</li><br /><li><strong>Access control.</strong>&nbsp;Alice and Bob are our best friends, but we know that Alice and Bob are inherently untrustworthy. We write your code to make sure Alice and Bob can&rsquo;t conspire against us or our users.</li><br /><li><strong>Speed.</strong>&nbsp;People expect a response to a text message in under 14 minutes. We&rsquo;re shooting for no more than 5. That means the platform needs to run fast, and crisis counselors need to be able to use it efficiently and effectively.</li><br /><li><strong>Testing.</strong>&nbsp;Testing isn&rsquo;t just clicking buttons. Testing means optimizing user experience and listening to your users rather than your gut. And of course, running automated tests too. You would never deploy untested code into production. Duh.</li><br /><li><strong>Cloud.</strong>&nbsp;We think scale. The cloud isn&rsquo;t a solution, it&rsquo;s an assumption.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Our team:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Custom, home-grown Symfony2 app for SMS-web interaction</li><br /><li>Drupal 7 installation for managing remote volunteers</li><br /><li>Slack chat bots because `@robot animate me &lt;kittens&gt;` is important</li><br /><li>1 CTO, 3 engineers, and we're hiring at least 3 more engineers in the coming months</li><br /></ul>" ;

But in addition to those technical skills we need engineers that live to hear the word &ldquo;thanks&rdquo;. As in &ldquo;thanks, your script saved me 50-60 hours of work this month.\" Or &ldquo;thanks, that new system you put in place lets us easily try different mathematical models which we thought were too difficult to experiment with.&rdquo;</p><br /><p>Obviously finding this blend of serious technical skills and personality is not easy, but we are willing to work to find you, the perfect candidate.</p><br /><p>We also added some perks to sweeten the deal:</p><br /><ul><br /><li><br /><p>Breakfast and lunch cooked in house every day by a team of chefs</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Wear whatever you want to work (there are no customers, remember?)</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Regular team events that are actually fun (for example: beer brewing, wine tasting lessons, ping pong tournaments, soccer teams, fancy dinners)</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>One of the best health insurance plans you can get in NYC</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Very small company with a flat organizational structure</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Tech-oriented leadership - all of our Partners are programmers</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Almost no multithreaded programming</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>All of the biggest monitors</p><br /></li><br /></ul>" ;

Improved usability for both customers and moderators. More reviews, more interaction, less spam, better conversion rates.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>What a day in the office might look like<br></strong>You open a pull request in GitHub for your last changes in the Javascript codebase of one of the back-end services for our new faceted-search functionality. You have fixed a bug in a de-serialisation method that was causing metadata to leak from JSON objects. Considering the large amount of simultaneous, relatively small requests these services process, Node.js seemed the obvious choice. So you had to abandon your usual work field of PHP and give the old Javascript another chance. Once again it proved itself a powerful language, capable of building beautiful stuff. Maybe the front-enders were right after all? Now that this has been tackled, you return to PHP. You had this idea to optimise the determination of the sorting order of the filters on the site...</p><br /><p><strong>Team<br></strong>You will be working in a team with three to five other developers, each of them with their own specialization, ranging from PHP to Javascript. Your team will be complemented by a Scrum Master and a Product Owner.</p>" ;

Whether it&rsquo;s gaming, e-commerce, advertising, publishing, or IoT, our platform aims to make Analytics so easy for developers that they can focus entirely on their product. Every day, every week, every month our challenge is to scale with a constantly growing data deluge and evolve along with our user&rsquo;s needs.</p><br /><p>About the Platform Team</p><br /><p>We work together in a pretty novel fashion - servant leaders are elected from the team, by the team. Responsibilities normally held by a single manager are separated across multiple roles. We have very open discussions about our shared priorities.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re always iterating on how we work and what we build. We&rsquo;re growing fast and we know that what worked a year ago won&rsquo;t necessarily work a year from now. This applies both to the technology and the organizations of our teams. We want to provide the best analytics experience for developers and co-create the best work environment for each other - willingness to evolve is essential.</p><br /><p>About the Job</p><br /><p>By centralizing a data pipeline for hundreds of companies, we operate at a scale that none of them have to worry about. Looking to the horizon, we need to look at every piece of our infrastructure with a critical eye. We need to stay ahead of the curve. You will help us be thoughtful and deliberate about tackling the right bottlenecks at the right time. You&rsquo;ll help make working on the platform easier and easier. You&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to gain deep understanding of distributed systems and teach others! Most importantly, you&rsquo;ll collaborate with some pretty amazing humans.</p>" ;

We are lean and fast, and theres a tight loop among our entire team. Were all about automation, intelligent distributed systems, and quick iteration.</p><p><strong><strong>The role</strong></strong></p><p>Were looking to add a new member to our small but fast growing engineering team: an Integration Engineer who can draw on their passion for infrastructure-as-code along with their broad community knowledge and connections to craft all manner of integrations for our cutting edge DNS platform. This dynamic position will involve writing and maintaining code in various languages - much of it open source - centered around getting data into and out of our platform. Youll work on in-house repos as well as contribute to various well known community infrastructure projects. Youll also work in our REST API and other internal systems to create and maintain integrations with other SaaS platforms.</p><p>No matter which language, you will be expected to write clean, maintainable, and fully tested code along with top notch documentation. You should have experience working on open source projects in a distributed environment (typically GitHub), including handling tasks like Pull Requests and Issues. Knowledge of various Continuous Integration systems such as Buildbot and TravisCI will be helpful. You should be familiar with the package distribution systems of various programming languages such as pip, gem, npm, etc and ideally have some experience contributing to them.  </p><p>You should have good general knowledge of the modern internet infrastructure landscape, especially well known and up-and-coming infrastructure-as-code projects and various IaaS and SaaS providers in the space.</p><p>Youll need to be able to quickly digest and understand diverse technical documentation and APIs of varying quality. Communication skills are equally important as youll be expected to maintain relationships with the project leaders, providers and services that youll be integrating with. Youll take ownership of all the integrations and work autonomously towards aggressive development goals.</p><p>Some stuff youll work on:</p><ul>	<li>REST API clients (to our service), in various languages (open source)</li>	<li>Integrations with other SaaS platforms related to both ingesting data into our platform as well as pushing notifications externally. Examples include Pingdom, New Relic, Datadog, Catchpoint, Pagerduty</li>	<li>Create and maintain NSONE DNS modules for various configuration management systems such as Ansible, Chef, Puppet</li>	<li>Create and maintain NSONE DNS modules in infrastructure projects such as Terraform, libcloud, fog.io, Netflix denominator</li>	<li>Maintain developer relationships with all of these providers and projects</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Working @ NSONE</strong></strong></p><p>Were a small, well funded startup with a casual work environment and strong work ethic. Theres a lot to do so we keep meetings and process to a minimum. Were headquartered in NYCs Financial District. We like to have fun, but skip most of the fancy startup gimmicks (fresh beer yes, gourmet chef and afternoon yoga no). We prefer candidates local to NYC or SFO, but will happily consider well qualified remote employees.</p><p>We offer:</p><ul>	<li>competitive compensation (salary and stock options)</li>	<li>medical, dental, and vision</li>	<li>commuter benefits</li>	<li>401k</li>	<li>flexible hours and time off</li></ul><p>NSONE is an equal opportunity employer.</p>" ;

    ns2:description "<p><strong>You</strong></p><br /><p>Noom is looking for an awesome Software Engineer who's&nbsp;a true team player and passionate about engineering, with tons of programming&nbsp;experience (doesn't matter if it was at Apple or in your mom&rsquo;s basement) and excellent communication skills. A CS background or degree usually helps a lot, but is not a strict requirement if you really know your stuff.</p><br /><p><strong>Our Tech</strong></p><br /><p>At our core, we are a team of great engineers from world-class companies, so we take our tech very seriously. We work to improve our tools and approaches every day -- whether pushing the envelope with automated unit-tests or writing a super-optimized data analysis framework. We don't over-engineer and also don't under-engineer -- just the right tool for the job.</p><br /><p>We take great pride in our code because we all want to innovate quickly. We build everything from Android software to C++ image recognition, from web UI to pedometer data analysis. Our apps operate off-line, and we have built lots of client-side infrastructure to lazily load and sync data with the server. This allows us to keep the server side relatively simple while still serving millions of users: Spring/Flask, Spring MVC, mySQL/Mongo.</p><br /><p>We run Hadoop-based machine learning to find out what makes people stick to habits, create online clustering algorithms to match people to their ideal support group, serve millions of users with many terabytes of data, and tackle many difficult challenges every day. Because we are small dev team (17 strong), working at Noom gives you the unique opportunity to both use what we have created and build many more foundational technologies. &nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Our Culture</strong></p><br /><p>We have worked hard to build an awesome company culture, stealing a bit from Google (many of us are ex-Googlers) and improving on it to become one of Crain&rsquo;s &ldquo;Best Places to Work in NYC 2013&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our tech team works with a ton of interesting Noomers and advisers, including our in-house psychologist as well as fitness experts, physicians and researchers. &nbsp;We test our prototypes on sample users, averaging 2 user-tests a day, so you&rsquo;ll be able to see how real people react to your work and iterate. &nbsp;So unlike most tech companies, you&rsquo;ll interact with a diverse network of people. &nbsp;After all, we are team of problem solvers, always interested in learning and growing.</p><br /><p>If you&rsquo;re worried about being pigeonholed, fear not. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get to choose a mission (usually for 4 - 6 months) and work on the projects you&rsquo;re interested in. We also have frequent company-wide hackathons. Everyone on the team is a generalist -- we explore new frameworks, and learn them quickly. We like to learn.</p><br /><p>We are now ready to double the size of our engineering team with some incredible engineers (read on below!).</p><br /><p><strong>Our Company</strong></p><br /><p>Noom, Inc. is a mobile solutions company focused on preventative health.</p><br /><p>Noom's research-backed products help people achieve real, positive outcomes. Noom was awarded a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and was also recently selected as one of seven healthcare startups chosen to participate in the 2014&nbsp;New York Digital Health Accelerator&nbsp;(NYDHA).</p><br /><p>Noom's apps boast more than 32&nbsp;million installs worldwide and its flagship app&nbsp;Noom Coach&nbsp;for Android has been the #1 top grossing Health and Fitness App since 2012 in the Google Play Store. Noom has offices in New York City, Berlin, Seoul and Tokyo.</p><br /><p>But we need your help -- read on if you think you&rsquo;ve got the stuff.</p><br /><p><strong>Our Products</strong></p><br /><p>At Noom we tackle some of the world&rsquo;s biggest problems -- obesity, diabetes and heart disease. &nbsp;We believe the best way to do this is by focusing on nutrition (TechCrunch) and fitness (GigaOm). &nbsp;More than just counting calories, our mobile software applications offer intelligent, scientifically-backed, customized nutrition- and exercise-coaching designed to impact habits and behavior. &nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our flagship app, Noom Weight Loss Coach, has been the #1 top grossing health &amp; fitness application since 2012. &nbsp;It achieves the best outcomes in the industry with over 10 pounds lost per paid member. &nbsp;How, you ask? &nbsp;Great question! &nbsp;It has:</p><br /><p>* A coaching engine that generates personalized daily tasks &amp; realtime motivational feedback;</p><br /><p>* The world&rsquo;s most accurate food database, crowd-sourced by users &amp; instantly searchable;</p><br /><p>* Virtual support groups created using automated clustering technology and tracked using scalable management tools.</p><br /><p>* A focus on simplicity and friendliness, to make all of the above easy to use</p><br /><p>* Many more features focused around guidance &amp; motivation for our users</p><br /><p><strong>Our Benefits</strong></p><br /><p>If you want to learn how a startup really works on the inside, then Noom is the place for you. We have an incredible amount of transparency, with weekly all-company TGIFs where the wine and the information both flow freely (much to our legal counsel&rsquo;s dismay). &nbsp;Because you&rsquo;ll have equity in the company and have to make many decisions in your work, it&rsquo;s important for you to know what&rsquo;s going on. &nbsp;</p><br /><p>We have an amazing chef (we love her!) who prepares gourmet lunches every day for all employees (along with afternoon smoothies and random breakfasts and dinners), a lively office with frequent visitors, and a dedicated team who work hard and play hard, with frequent offsites (beach, anyone?) and team outings (from shuffleboard to wine tasting). &nbsp;We also have more cakes than is probably healthy (welcome cakes, birthday cakes, goodbye cakes and cakes just because -- no joke).</p><br /><p>Plus health insurance (100% paid by Noom) and a 401(k). We also have a $200 wellness budget, which you can spend on everything from triathlon registration fees to massages.</p>" ;

    ns2:description "<p><strong>Please note that this position is open to US candidates only. This is a direct, full-time position. If you are a placement agency or a recruiter please do not apply.</strong></p><br /><p><strong>At this time we are only interested in candidates that either live in the Washington D.C. metro area or are willing to relocate.</strong></p><br /><p>Hi. We&rsquo;re looking for an awesome Rails Developer to join our growing team. If you&rsquo;ve ever wanted to work for a interesting security startup with great people this is your chance. We&rsquo;re a little different than your average startup so we put together this FAQ.</p><br /><p>Q: Ok who are you guys?</p><br /><p>A: Stratum is comprised of some really smart security hackers who were tired of working for large companies. There are people here from MITRE, HP, Fortify, RSA, Verizon Business, Cybertrust, and others. We wanted to do the small company thing and it&rsquo;s worked well for us. &nbsp;This is our second new product launch. &nbsp;Our first was ThreatSim, which was very successful and taught us many lessons.</p><br /><p>Q: What would I be working on?</p><br /><p>A: You&rsquo;d be working on our data exfiltration testing platform, XFIL, which simulates data exfiltration techniques often used by hackers and helps customers identify areas for improvement in their egress controls. &nbsp;Let me translate that for non-security people --- remember the Target hack? &nbsp;They lost 70-90M credit card numbers -- hackers were able to get on Target&rsquo;s network and transmit the data off for several months without getting noticed. &nbsp;The part where they transmit the data is referred to as &ldquo;exfiltration&rdquo;. &nbsp;Our service enables organizations&rsquo; to test their ability to identify a data breach in motion. &nbsp;As you can imagine it&rsquo;s a capability every organization needs these days.</p><br /><p>Essentially we get to think like bad guys and help our customers improve their security. It&rsquo;s an interesting space to say the least. If you ever wanted to learn more about security and cutting-edge attacks, this is the place. We simulate evil AND give our customers data that they can use to protect their organization. You will spend a lot of time thinking &ldquo;if I was a bad guy I&rsquo;d&hellip;&rdquo; then have to pivot and think &ldquo;if I was a security engineer I&rsquo;d&hellip;&rdquo;</p><br /><p>Q: Where is this position located?</p><br /><p>A: &nbsp;Ideally we would love this position to be based out of our office in Herndon, VA. &nbsp;This is a key role contributing to a new product offering. &nbsp;The opportunity to interact with our team will be valuable. &nbsp;However, we are still open to non-local candidates. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve had great experience with remote developers over the years. &nbsp;While not required -- please let us know if you are open to relocation at some point.</p><br /><p>Q: What will my day to day be like as a developer?</p><br /><p>A: This depends on whether you are based out of our office or remote. &nbsp;In either scenario, you work on new features, enhancements, and issues to ensure that XFIL continues to be awesome. You keep in touch with the team using Slack, Skype, Join.me, Google Hangout, and even an ol&rsquo; IP phone. Using your company provided Macbook you write code, commit to Github, and listen to your friends complain about traffic on Facebook. From time to time you may respond to a customer support ticket. &nbsp;</p><br /><p>We do not require employees to be at their desk 9-5. &nbsp;We expect employees to be professional and get their job done -- and to be available when the job requires it. &nbsp;XFIL is a new project, so expect a great deal of collaboration. &nbsp;If you work better at night, then communicate when you&rsquo;ll be available, and figure out when people need you. &nbsp;In the end - it&rsquo;s all about results.</p><br /><p>Q: Who will I be working with?</p><br /><p>A: Other developers, devops, sales, and maybe even customers. We&rsquo;re a 20 person company so needless to say you&rsquo;ll know everyone on a first name basis.</p><br /><p>Q: What hours do you work?</p><br /><p>A: We generally work &ldquo;normal&rdquo; office hours but are flexible. Most of us are on the east coast (DC area) but as long as you are in the lower 48 we&rsquo;re good. We&rsquo;re a startup, so sometimes there are long hours. But we all have families so we aim for a good work-life balance.</p><br /><p>Q: What technology do you use?</p><br /><p>A: XFIL is built entirely within Amazon Web Services. Linux, load balancers, auto-scaling, sidekiq, redis, ansible, git, Splunk, HIDS, two-factor auth, disk encryption, and a lot of cool security stuff that you probably aren&rsquo;t used to seeing in a startup.</p><br /><p>Q: What skills and qualities are you looking for in a candidate?</p><br /><p>A: Here&rsquo;s a bullet list:</p><br /><p>&ndash; Ruby on Rails 3.0+</p><br /><p>&ndash; Relational and non-relational databases: MySQL, Redis</p><br /><p>&ndash; Background job processors (e.g. Sidekiq)</p><br /><p>&ndash; Javascript frameworks (e.g. jQuery, pure JS)</p><br /><p>&ndash; Frontend frameworks (e.g. Bootstrap)</p><br /><p>&ndash; Client-side and server side MVC</p><br /><p>&ndash; Comfortable with git for version control</p><br /><p>&ndash; Continuous integration</p><br /><p>&ndash; MS Office (hah right, could you imagine?)</p><br /><p>The ideal candidate will be comfortable working remote and managing themselves. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re not looking for regular employees -- only apply if you have a need &amp; desire to be involved, voice opinions, build the team/company, etc&hellip; this is start-up mode and not a 9-5 job. You will be an integral part of the team with a huge impact on the future of our product. We&rsquo;re passionate about what we do and you should be too.</p><br /><p>Q: How often do we get together in person?</p><br /><p>A: For people local to DC we try to get together for lunch every few weeks. For those that are remote we have a few events every year (company picnic, go-kart racing, paintball, holiday party, etc.) Some of the folks here brew beer so I suspect that they hang out more often.</p><br /><p>Q: What benefits do you offer?</p><br /><p>A: The salary is competitive and depends on your experience. We offer the following:</p><br /><p>&ndash; Medical, dental, and vision insurance</p><br /><p>&ndash; SIMPLE IRA with company match</p><br /><p>&ndash; PTO - We use the Netflix model and do not track PTO. &nbsp;Use what you need and be responsible are the guidelines. &nbsp;For those that need numbers -- we tell people to work under the notion that you get 3 weeks PTO for new employees, 4 weeks for employees with us longer than a year.</p><br /><p>&ndash; 8 federal holidays</p><br /><p>&ndash; Choose your own laptop (hint: we like Apple products)</p><br /><p>Apply for this position</p><br /><p>If you are interested in helping evolve information security, tell us about yourself at careers@stratumsecurity.com. Send us your LinkedIn profile, Github repo, or anything else you feel would help us get to know you.</p>" ;

    ns2:description "<p>After witnessing several family members and friends battle cancer, Flatiron Health was founded in 2012 by Nat Turner and Zach Weinberg. Headquartered in New York City, our company is building a disruptive software platform that connects cancer centers across the country to help change the face of cancer.</p><br /><p><strong>In 2014, we&nbsp;raised $130MM in series B funding from Google Ventures,&nbsp;the second largest investment ever from Google Ventures, behind Uber.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our mission is to organize the world&rsquo;s oncology information and make it useful for patients, physicians, life sciences and researchers. Our team is building a disruptive, oncology-specific software platform that will connect cancer centers across the country on a common technology infrastructure and address key healthcare challenges. Today, our proprietary cloud platform includes the industry-leading electronic medical record for oncology, a first-of-its-kind analytics tool, patient portal, and integrated billing management.&nbsp;Ultimately, our goal is to help cancer centers leverage real-world oncology data, at a scale and clinical depth never before seen, to transform how cancer care is delivered.</p><br /><p><strong>Our engineering team</strong></p><br /><p>Our engineering team builds and runs data processing pipelines, algorithmic and human-operated data curation tools, and customer-facing data analytics and visualization products. We build systems that clean, structure and understand clinical-level patient data as we build the largest, most comprehensive set of oncology data intelligence. We scale pipelines to handle the world's oncology data with creative engineering solutions to open-ended oncology data problems.</p><br /><p><strong>Our data</strong></p><br /><p>Our data pipeline takes in full clinical patient records and produces normalized, high-fidelity, queryable data that is ready to be mined for medical and operational insights. We&rsquo;ve built a unified data set that is unparalleled in its depth and accuracy, and which gives our partners the capability to ask questions about data that weren't answerable until now.</p><br /><p><strong>Our culture</strong></p><br /><p>We work in a fast-paced, high-information-volume environment with complex domain challenges, which means context is key and there's always more to learn and soak up. We want to know oncology data cold &mdash; better than anyone else in the industry &mdash; and we believe doing so requires building a culture where we all like coming to work each day. In our culture, decisions are transparent and data-driven, and people are empowered to make waves.</p><br /><p><strong>Backend Software Engineer</strong></p><br /><p>Are you interested in building elegant and scalable systems to help our customers unleash the power of their data?</p><br /><p>As a Backend Software Engineer you will:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Design and implement backend components: services, data stores, infrastructure, instrumentation, and deployment</li><br /><li>Continuously ship new features for our cloud based infrastructure</li><br /><li>Write simple, elegant, testable code</li><br /><li>Drive improvements to our backend infrastructures</li><br /></ul><br /><p>About you:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>You hold a BS, MS, or PhD in computer science or related field</li><br /><li>You have strong backend experience with languages like Python, C++ or Java</li><br /><li>You have a good understanding of online relational databases like Postgresql, MySQL or MSSQL.</li><br /><li>You are passionate about performance, reliability, and scalability of systems</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Full Stack Software Engineer</strong></p><br /><p>Are you interested in using modern web technologies to help our customers unleash the power of their data?</p><br /><p>As a Full Stack Software Engineer you will:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Design and implement intuitive web interfaces to make complex data accessible and useful</li><br /><li>Continuously ship new features for our cloud applications, from the backend to the frontend</li><br /><li>Write simple, elegant, testable code</li><br /><li>Drive improvements to our backend and frontend infrastructure</li><br /></ul><br /><p>About you:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>You hold a BS or MS in computer science or related field</li><br /><li>You have strong frontend web experience with JS, HTML, and CSS</li><br /><li>You have strong backend experience with languages like Python, Ruby or Java, and SQL databases</li><br /><li>You are passionate about empowering users and our mission to improve healthcare through technology</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Bonus points if you&hellip;</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Contribute to open source projects</li><br /><li>Have developed apps using modern frontend frameworks like AngularJS / Ember.js</li><br /><li>Have experience in user experience design or user experience research</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Data Software Engineer</strong></p><br /><p>Do you want to synthesize data into knowledge?</p><br /><p>As a Data Software Engineer you will:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Write useful and impactful software</li><br /><li>Design and build our data infrastructure, and use it to develop extensible, robust data pipelines</li><br /><li>Build tools and infrastructure for easy, accessible and flexible data analysis</li><br /><li>Iteratively develop, operationalize and monitor machine-assisted and statistical solutions to problems</li><br /></ul><br /><p>About you:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>You hold a BS, MS, or PhD in computer science or engineering</li><br /><li>You write clean, well-structured, production-quality code in Python, C++ or Java</li><br /><li>You have built and deployed large-scale data processing pipelines</li><br /><li>You seek simple approaches to complex problems</li><br /><li>You are passionate about our mission to improve healthcare through technology</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Bonus points if you&hellip;</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Have a strong understanding of statistics</li><br /><li>Have developed distributed data processing systems against large, heterogeneous data sets</li><br /><li>Understand experimental design, and can build for collection, measurement and interpretation of results</li><br /></ul>" ;
