And we laugh &amp;ndash; all the time. You'll get the opportunity to work at an institution pushing the boundaries of open data transparency, while collaborating with some of the industry&amp;rsquo;s brightest engineers and data scientists to devise, nurture, and implement cutting-edge solutions to continuously evolving engineering obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Position&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Willy Wonka said &amp;ldquo;We are the dreamers of dreams.&amp;rdquo; Well, FiscalNote front-end engineers are the architects that make our open data dreams come true. Wild ambition isn&amp;rsquo;t lacking at FiscalNote, and only the most talented can visualize open-data products that have never been built before. Our front-end engineers love what they do, and they are on a mission to continuously improve upon and build the most beautiful and useful user interfaces the open data world has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Creative. Ambitious. Communicative. Driven. &amp;nbsp;You yearn to exercise your abilities in a greater capacity than on a tiny feature of a much larger product. Lending your talents across our entire stack, you not only love sharing your savvy with the team, but also crave the opportunity to absorb any and all knowledge from our hyper-collaborative environment. Your appreciation (bordering on obsession) for clean code and attention to detail have helped you shine brightly at previous positions. You&amp;rsquo;re tickled by the idea of implementing inventive uses of older technologies, but even more revved at the idea of leveraging the most modern front-end tools, frameworks, and languages. Most of all, though, you live to engineer creative interfaces that take the user experience to a whole new level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;- 2+ years of industry experience programming in JavaScript&lt;br&gt;- Expertise with HTML5 and CSS3&lt;br&gt;- Expertise with jQuery&lt;br&gt;- Knowledge of algorithms, data structures and Object Oriented programming&lt;br&gt;- Knowledge of and experience with JavaScript MV* frameworks. Ember.js is highly recommended.&lt;br&gt;- Undergraduate and/or graduate degree in engineering, computer science, or related technical field (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Preferred&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;)&lt;br&gt;- Proficient with Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, or related design software (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Preferred&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;)&lt;br&gt;- UI/UX design experience (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Ideal&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In becoming a FiscalNoter, you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy a plethora of benefits that you would expect at both an established company and at a startup. More importantly, though, is the opportunity to develop software that impacts real decisions -- decisions that substantially affect governing in the US and abroad. You will hone your engineering skills among peers just as motivated and skilled as you are, and in the process, develop a tight-knit camaraderie that will transcend simple software development.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2015 15:08:27 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-08-06T15:08:27Z</a10:updated><location>Washington, DC</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/91831/computer-science-trainer-bloomberg-lp</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/91831/computer-science-trainer-bloomberg-lp</link><a10:author><a10:name>Bloomberg LP</a10:name></a10:author><category>c++</category><category>java</category><category>unix</category><title>Computer Science Trainer at Bloomberg LP (New York, NY)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Role:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bloomberg R&amp;amp;D is responsible for creating and maintaining all functions within the Bloomberg Professional Service.

We are now expanding our Oklahoma City team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We are looking for entry-level programmers that have some formal computer science training, but are just starting their careers. You should know javascript and some javascript libraries like jQuery, D3, etc, and have an interest in data visualization, data science, and internet technologies. Most importantly, you should be hungry to build big, important applications that matter, and looking for projects to flex your newly developed coding muscles on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Experience with a variety of different internet technologies would be a bonus, but not necessary - we view this very much as a learn-on-the-job type position and as a result are valuing smarts, motivation and desire-to-learn over experience. These positions will be based in downtown OKC, but with the opportunity for travel to Exaptive's Boston and Vancouver locations. The position will have the opportunity to evolve into a role in which the person has an equity-stake in the company. The right person will be excited about the dynamic and fast-paced (aka stressful) environment of a startup and view that as a benefit, not a drawback. The startup environment is not for everyone, but for the person who is looking for that sort of life experience, the opportunity to help build something from the ground up where individual contributions make immediate and substantial impacts on the company as a whole can be extremely rewarding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Those interested can find out more about the company, and view some demo videos of our software in actionon our website: www.exaptive.com. We were featured on the front page of the Business Innovation section of The Boston Globe (http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2013/12/cambridge-based_exaptive_wants.html) and in Oklahoma City's The Journal Record (http://www.i2e.org/news/innovators-exaptive-inc/). Our Founder and CEO, Dave King, has been invited internationally to present our work. You can see a video of a presentation he recently gave to the Oklahoma Venture Forum about Exaptive's big-picture vision on our website.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If you don't currently live in Oklahoma City, you should check out what this up-and-coming city has to offer: a burgeoning tech startup and creative sector, the largest food truck event in the nation, olympic rowing facilities, and a cost of living that can't be beat.

The Tableau Mobile team has been tasked with a single mission: to make the mobile experience the most delightful way for our customers to stay on top of their data. We build next-generation apps for iOS and Android for consumers and enterprises alike, and ensure quality through a variety of modern, innovative techniques, including white-box automation, data-driven pair-wise testing, and instrumentation tools.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Platform:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a member of one of our platform teams you&amp;rsquo;ll work on Tableau&amp;rsquo;s secret sauce.

We are now expanding our Oklahoma City team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We are looking for an experience security architect that has designed scaleable and secure web application, and is also comfortable performing penetration testing and security analysis of systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Some of the challenges of designing the Exaptive platform is that its goal is to be extended by third-party components, and those components will be bought and sold in a component store much like the Apple app store. This opens up opportunities for malicious code as well as introducing the complexity of financial transaction processing. On top of that, Exaptive frequently gets used for data science in fields that have confidential and proprietary data. So we're looking for someone with experience designing architectures that can deal with these things - someone with experience designing sandbox systems for large-scale multi-user environments, with financial transaction processsing applications, and with designing systems with secure data handling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This position will be based in downtown OKC, but with the opportunity for travel to Exaptive's Boston and Vancouver locations. The position will have the opportunity to evolve into a role in which the person has an equity-stake in the company. The right person will be excited about the dynamic and fast-paced (aka stressful) environment of a startup and view that as a benefit, not a drawback. The startup environment is not for everyone, but for the person who is looking for that sort of life experience, the opportunity to help build something from the ground up where individual contributions make immediate and substantial impacts on the company as a whole can be extremely rewarding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Those interested can find out more about the company, and view some demo videos of our software in actionon our website: www.exaptive.com. We were featured on the front page of the Business Innovation section of The Boston Globe (http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2013/12/cambridge-based_exaptive_wants.html) and in Oklahoma City's The Journal Record (http://www.i2e.org/news/innovators-exaptive-inc/). Our Founder and CEO, Dave King, has been invited internationally to present our work. You can see a video of a presentation he recently gave to the Oklahoma Venture Forum about Exaptive's big-picture vision on our website.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't currently live in Oklahoma City, you should check out what this up-and-coming city has to offer: a burgeoning tech startup and creative sector, the largest food truck event in the nation, olympic rowing facilities, and a cost of living that can't be beat.

Exaptive is more than just a data analytics platform. It's a complete ecosystem for data science - that means it is comprised of a bunch of different pieces that all have to work together. There is the web-based development environment, the Xap Store, and the Cognitive Network. Each component introduces its own set of infrastructure requirements. In addition, we have a consulting branch of the business which sometimes needs infrastructure design decisions in response to unique custom client requirements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This position will be based in downtown OKC, but with the opportunity for travel to Exaptive's Boston and Vancouver locations.

The right person will be excited about the dynamic and fast-paced (aka stressful) environment of a startup and view that as a benefit, not a drawback. The startup environment is not for everyone, but for the person who is looking for that sort of life experience, the opportunity to help build something from the ground up where individual contributions make immediate and substantial impacts on the company as a whole can be extremely rewarding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Those interested can find out more about the company, and view some demo videos of our software in actionon our website: www.exaptive.com.

In fact, our impressive working culture has recently earned us 1st place in the &lt;strong&gt;Sunday Times 100 Best Companies to Work for 2015&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have two different positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Senior or Lead Developers who would like to lead a team / projects (fulltime in London)&lt;/strong&gt; - We envisage the split here being about 70% hands-on coding and 30% leading the team, liaising with product owners on prioritization work, attending iteration planning meetings with stakeholders, delegating tasks to dev team, and making sure we are following Lean / Agile processes correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Senior Developers who want to be 100% hands-on coders with no lead responsibilities (this can be fulltime in London OR remote) -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;This role will be 100% hands on working with our other Devs to code beautiful products for our customers!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please be aware the salary will vary dependent on experience and whether you are working remotely or onsite in London)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of our Current Projects:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seedy -&lt;/strong&gt; Our custom built CMS. A hybrid,&amp;nbsp;markdown based, sinatra driven CMS but with&amp;nbsp;a TDD undercurrent. Content changes are no&amp;nbsp;different to backend refactoring. Templates are&amp;nbsp;written in a custom DSL that enforces our style&amp;nbsp;guide while still supporting iterative changes&amp;nbsp;and automatic deployment. Across the company&amp;nbsp;people (including business teams) are now being&amp;nbsp;tagged in pull requests and even writing code!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aerie -&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;rsquo;re overhauling our data and analytics&amp;nbsp;architecture. Using the latest approaches in&amp;nbsp;event streaming, we are building a brand new&amp;nbsp;data pipeline based on Kinesis and Redshift that&amp;nbsp;will support the analysis of both structured and&amp;nbsp;semi-structured data in near real-time. This will&amp;nbsp;provide rapid and intuitive customer insight&amp;nbsp;to our decision makers, while also providing&amp;nbsp;exciting machine learning capabilities back to&amp;nbsp;our core product offering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AAA - &lt;/strong&gt;We are enhancing our new world platform.&amp;nbsp;Our current focus is on security with a view to&amp;nbsp;building out &amp;lsquo;infrastructure as code&amp;rsquo; using tools&amp;nbsp;such as AWS CloudFormation, AWS OpsWorks,&amp;nbsp;Chef/Puppet and many others. Essentially, we&amp;nbsp;believe a well architected system allows us to&amp;nbsp;avoid unnecessary complexity and can enable&amp;nbsp;individuals to generate great output.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Tech Stack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ruby&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rails &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scala &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;MongoDB&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Puppet/Boxen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;AWS &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hadoop /&amp;nbsp;RedShift / Looker /Tableau&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cucumber / RSpec / Jasmine &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;SASS / HAML / HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript / CoffeeScript / jQuery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;This list changes all the time, as being on&amp;nbsp;the lookout for new technology trials and&amp;nbsp;opportunities is part of our code.

And if you&amp;rsquo;re not up for a wee jaunt to the pub, there&amp;rsquo;s always beer and juice in the fridge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we are looking for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cloudreach is looking for a number of capable sysadmin engineers or developers who have a passion for operations with 3-5 years relevant experience who are keen to grow their technical and business skills in a fast growing company. We&amp;rsquo;d like to see someone who has had exposure to infrastructure with automation. If you are curious about the Cloud and have possibly dabbled with AWS and Google Apps we want to speak to you. We subscribe to the concept of "DevOps", where we use development skills in the operational environment in order to increase service quality. Typically our customers use an extensive array of technology running on either Linux (with Open Source) or the Microsoft stack.&lt;br&gt;The beauty of this role is that as the hardware layer is abstracted, you focus on honing your technical skills, and the interesting stuff, rather the heavy lifting. The intent is to fix or work around the root cause of operational issues, so that they do not reoccur.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will be working with the following new technologies (and more):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Linux / Open Source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Microsoft technologies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Management of and automation of management of these systems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amazon Elastic Computing cloud&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Google Apps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Action incident / problem cases related to the support of customer systems in line with Service Level Agreements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Liaise with customer directly in the case of major incidents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Carry out pro-active maintenance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Action service requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ensure knowledge of the platforms is accurately maintained&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Produce statistical information as required to support ITIL reports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Assist in customer migrations by Service Delivery teams (to Google Apps / Amazon Web Services)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2015 07:08:27 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-08-28T07:08:27Z</a10:updated><location>Edinburgh, UK</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/91490/data-scientist-the-walking-dead-next-games</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/91490/data-scientist-the-walking-dead-next-games</link><a10:author><a10:name>Next Games</a10:name></a10:author><category>python</category><category>r</category><category>bigdata</category><category>hadoop</category><category>machine-learning</category><title>Data Scientist (The Walking Dead) at Next Games (Helsinki, Finland)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a startup-minded pro with a passion for games and a brain that can tackle&amp;nbsp;any given problem in a unique way, then keep on reading as we&amp;rsquo;re on the look for our new team member for The Walking Dead game team:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATA SCIENTIST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As our Data Scientist, you&amp;rsquo;re responsible for generating insights from large data sets produced by our games and players.

You have fixed a bug in a de-serialisation method that was causing metadata to leak from JSON objects. Considering the large amount of simultaneous, relatively small requests these services process, Node.js seemed the obvious choice. So you had to abandon your usual work field of PHP and give the old Javascript another chance. Once again it proved itself a powerful language, capable of building beautiful stuff. Maybe the front-enders were right after all? Now that this has been tackled, you return to PHP. You had this idea to optimise the determination of the sorting order of the filters on the site...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;You will be working in a team with three to five other developers, each of them with their own specialization, ranging from PHP to Javascript.

Je rapporteert de testresultaten aan het team en benadrukt pijnpunten.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Om Hansken continu te kunnen blijven verbeteren, zorg jij er met de ontwikkelaars voor dat testplannen worden omgezet in geautomatiseerde tests. Voor het geautomatiseerd testen van onze applicaties gebruiken wij op dit moment het test framework JBehave in combinatie met de Selenium web driver. Deze tests maken onderdeel uit van een continuous delivery proces, waarbij we vanuit onze issue tracker met 1 druk op de knop Hansken kunnen bouwen, testen en uitrollen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2015 14:08:27 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-08-21T14:08:27Z</a10:updated><location>The Hague, Netherlands</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/94484/business-systems-and-data-developer-healthwise</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/94484/business-systems-and-data-developer-healthwise</link><a10:author><a10:name>Healthwise</a10:name></a10:author><title>Business Systems and Data Developer at Healthwise (Boise, ID)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Business Systems and Data Developer is a senior level systems developer responsible for designing, developing, and implementing enterprise-level applications, systems, and data models that support core internal business functions.

We build and maintain high-performance systems that process &amp;amp; deliver billions of data points per day. Our customers are key financial players that use our products to power their trading applications, settlement, risk management, corporate action processing, and much more. As a result, they require our system to be ultra-reliable and our data to be of the highest quality. Our product lines offer a variety of programmatic interfaces to a wide range of information on nearly all types of financial instruments including fixed income, CDS, currencies, equities, and futures &amp;amp; options. We interact closely with our business and sales teams and have many opportunities to design and develop innovative solutions to satisfy customer demands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Bloomberg Valuations (BVAL) product calculates pricing for over 2 million liquid and illiquid fixed income securities at several snapshots throughout the day. DL delivers this premium evaluated pricing data with related regulatory information to enterprise customers in order to meet requirements such as Net Asset Valuation calculations. We build solutions which calculate, validate, QC and deliver millions of data points in very short amount of time to fulfill client needs throughout the day. This rapidly growing product requires a highly efficient, scalable, and fault-tolerant architecture. To address the scalability needs of this product, we are working on a proof of concept using Hadoop. We are looking to dramatically increase our regulatory statistical offering by adding a suite of new products. These new offerings will allow our clients to evaluate their portfolio risks and help them meet the many new regulatory requirements that have been introduced and are currently being legislated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;In order to help us continue expanding our market share &amp;amp; reach, we are looking for a software developer to help us design and implement flexible, usable, and performant systems.

We build and nurture an Analytics API that processes user data and queries around the clock, across diverse industries. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s gaming, e-commerce, advertising, publishing, or IoT, our platform aims to make Analytics so easy for developers that they can focus entirely on their product. Every day, every week, every month our challenge is to scale with a constantly growing data deluge and evolve along with our user&amp;rsquo;s needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;About the Platform Team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We work together in a pretty novel fashion - servant leaders are elected from the team, by the team. Responsibilities normally held by a single manager are separated across multiple roles. We have very open discussions about our shared priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re always iterating on how we work and what we build. We&amp;rsquo;re growing fast and we know that what worked a year ago won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily work a year from now. This applies both to the technology and the organizations of our teams. We want to provide the best analytics experience for developers and co-create the best work environment for each other - willingness to evolve is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;About the Job&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;By centralizing a data pipeline for hundreds of companies, we operate at a scale that none of them have to worry about. Looking to the horizon, we need to look at every piece of our infrastructure with a critical eye. We need to stay ahead of the curve. You will help us be thoughtful and deliberate about tackling the right bottlenecks at the right time. You&amp;rsquo;ll help make working on the platform easier and easier. You&amp;rsquo;ll have the opportunity to gain deep understanding of distributed systems and teach others! Most importantly, you&amp;rsquo;ll collaborate with some pretty amazing humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2015 19:08:27 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-08-20T19:08:27Z</a10:updated><location>San Francisco, CA</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/94708/research-analyst-cybersecurity-institute-for-defense-analyses</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/94708/research-analyst-cybersecurity-institute-for-defense-analyses</link><a10:author><a10:name>Institute for Defense Analyses</a10:name></a10:author><category>communications</category><category>network</category><category>intelligence</category><category>surveillance</category><category>cybersecurity</category><title>Research Analyst - Cybersecurity at Institute for Defense Analyses (Alexandria, VA)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Operational Evaluation Division (OED) has an immediate career opening for an Analyst with operational or research experience to support cybersecurity assessments during operational testing of the effectiveness, suitability, and cybersecurity of Major Acquisition Programs in the Department of Defense.&amp;nbsp; IDA takes great pride in the rigor, quality, and timeliness of its analyses, which are produced in an atmosphere that encourages independent thinking and objective results.&amp;nbsp; Work at IDA is conducted in a team environment and often involves a multi-disciplinary approach.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Analyst will support and advise mid- and senior-level civilian and military Department of Defense regarding cybersecurity operational test and evaluation of Major Acquisition Programs.&amp;nbsp; The position involves analyzing the design, execution, and results of operational testing for cybersecurity to provide independent assessments to the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation.&amp;nbsp; Close interaction with officials responsible for the planning, development, and execution of such assessments and operational tests is required.&amp;nbsp; Strong scientific and technical skills, particularly in the area of quantitative analyses, are required, as well as the ability to speak and write clearly, think analytically, and work independently. &amp;nbsp;Travel is required.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2015 18:08:27 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-08-05T18:08:27Z</a10:updated><location>Alexandria, VA</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/96631/senior-software-engineer-aspnet-c-sharp-frontiers</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/96631/senior-software-engineer-aspnet-c-sharp-frontiers</link><a10:author><a10:name>Frontiers</a10:name></a10:author><category>asp.net</category><category>c#</category><category>sql-server</category><category>agile</category><category>rest</category><title>Senior Software Engineer ASP.NET C# at Frontiers (Lausanne, Switzerland)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a senior software engineer ASP.NET to join our Software Engineering team and take responsibility for one remote development team.&lt;br&gt;Your primary responsibilities include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lead the offshore development team to implement technical and functional improvements to our website and the integration of third party products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify opportunities to improve and accelerate the Frontiers platform, both technically and functionally, and coach the team in new technologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deep dive in performance and quality improvements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focus on delivering and maintaining an excellent user experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2015 08:08:27 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-08-31T08:08:27Z</a10:updated><location>Lausanne, Switzerland</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/93829/team-lead-platform-watty-ab</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/93829/team-lead-platform-watty-ab</link><a10:author><a10:name>Watty AB</a10:name></a10:author><category>python</category><category>microservices</category><category>rabbitmq</category><category>docker</category><category>linux</category><title>Team Lead Platform at Watty AB (Stockholm, Sweden)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Watty is connecting and making sense of the world's energy data in order to help consumers and companies use energy in smarter way.&amp;nbsp;Our platform already handles 20 million data points per day&amp;nbsp;- and it will be your your job to continue improving our platform to handle a 1000 times more.

Hansken draait op een gedistribueerde omgeving en verwerkt vele terabytes aan data per uur. Het analyseren van deze data kan miljoenen relevante sporen opleveren, denk&amp;nbsp; aan e-mails, chatberichten en GPS-co&amp;ouml;rdinaten. Door nieuwe technologische ontwikkelingen blijft het een uitdaging om steeds nieuwe typen forensische sporen doorzoekbaar te maken of slimme analyses toe te voegen, zoals entiteitextractie voor herkenning van kentekens, IBAN-nummers of adressen. Naast het dienen van een belangrijk maatschappelijk belang is Hansken ook een technisch zeer uitdagend project waar je telkens met nieuwe technieken in aanraking komt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Als forensisch software architect ben jij voor Hansken de persoon die de wensen van stakeholders vertaalt naar concrete oplossingen. Je bent communicatief sterk en kunt Hansken uiteenzetten aan klanten en het management. Samen met ontwikkelaars beoordeel je nieuwe technologie&amp;euml;n en frameworks op toepasbaarheid in de huidige architectuur. Vervolgens zorg je dat deze gebruikt worden. Je trekt de kar bij het besluitvormingsproces over gebruikte technologie en (technische) ontwerpbeslissingen op abstract niveau. Hierbij neem je onderbouwd besluiten en verdedig je deze. Bovendien leg je de architectuur vast en bewaak je deze.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Daarnaast ben je verantwoordelijk voor de kwaliteit van Hansken.

We are now expanding our Oklahoma City team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We are looking for experienced programmers that have formal computer science training and at least 5 years experience working in industry building high-performance web applications, not just CSS/HTML web pages. The right programmer for this position will be fluent in Javascript as well as a number of other languages. While they might be comfortable using framework libraries, they'll be the type of programmer that actually understands how the framework works, when it's appropriate, and when it's preferable to build thier own functionality directly. The right programmer for this position will *love* abstraction, strive for elegance, and will enjoy thinking about recursion until their brain hurts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This position will be based in downtown OKC, but with the opportunity for travel to Exaptive's Boston and Vancouver locations. The position will have the opportunity to evolve into a role in which the person has an equity-stake in the company. The right person will be excited about the dynamic and fast-paced (aka stressful) environment of a startup and view that as a benefit, not a drawback. The startup environment is not for everyone, but for the person who is looking for that sort of life experience, the opportunity to help build something from the ground up where individual contributions make immediate and substantial impacts on the company as a whole can be extremely rewarding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Those interested can find out more about the company, and view some demo videos of our software in actionon our website: www.exaptive.com. We were featured on the front page of the Business Innovation section of The Boston Globe (http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2013/12/cambridge-based_exaptive_wants.html) and in Oklahoma City's The Journal Record (http://www.i2e.org/news/innovators-exaptive-inc/).

We build everything from Android software to C++ image recognition, from web UI to pedometer data analysis. Our apps operate off-line, and we have built lots of client-side infrastructure to lazily load and sync data with the server. This allows us to keep the server side relatively simple while still serving millions of users: Spring/Flask, Spring MVC, mySQL/Mongo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We run Hadoop-based machine learning to find out what makes people stick to habits, create online clustering algorithms to match people to their ideal support group, serve millions of users with many terabytes of data, and tackle many difficult challenges every day. Because we are small dev team (17 strong), working at Noom gives you the unique opportunity to both use what we have created and build many more foundational technologies. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have worked hard to build an awesome company culture, stealing a bit from Google (many of us are ex-Googlers) and improving on it to become one of Crain&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Best Places to Work in NYC 2013&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our tech team works with a ton of interesting Noomers and advisers, including our in-house psychologist as well as fitness experts, physicians and researchers. &amp;nbsp;We test our prototypes on sample users, averaging 2 user-tests a day, so you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to see how real people react to your work and iterate. &amp;nbsp;So unlike most tech companies, you&amp;rsquo;ll interact with a diverse network of people. &amp;nbsp;After all, we are team of problem solvers, always interested in learning and growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re worried about being pigeonholed, fear not. &amp;nbsp;You&amp;rsquo;ll get to choose a mission (usually for 4 - 6 months) and work on the projects you&amp;rsquo;re interested in. We also have frequent company-wide hackathons. Everyone on the team is a generalist -- we explore new frameworks, and learn them quickly. We like to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are now ready to double the size of our engineering team with some incredible engineers (read on below!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noom, Inc. is a mobile solutions company focused on preventative health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noom's research-backed products help people achieve real, positive outcomes. Noom was awarded a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and was also recently selected as one of seven healthcare startups chosen to participate in the 2014&amp;nbsp;New York Digital Health Accelerator&amp;nbsp;(NYDHA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noom's apps boast more than 32&amp;nbsp;million installs worldwide and its flagship app&amp;nbsp;Noom Coach&amp;nbsp;for Android has been the #1 top grossing Health and Fitness App since 2012 in the Google Play Store. Noom has offices in New York City, Berlin, Seoul and Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we need your help -- read on if you think you&amp;rsquo;ve got the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Noom we tackle some of the world&amp;rsquo;s biggest problems -- obesity, diabetes and heart disease. &amp;nbsp;We believe the best way to do this is by focusing on nutrition (TechCrunch) and fitness (GigaOm). &amp;nbsp;More than just counting calories, our mobile software applications offer intelligent, scientifically-backed, customized nutrition- and exercise-coaching designed to impact habits and behavior. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our flagship app, Noom Weight Loss Coach, has been the #1 top grossing health &amp;amp; fitness application since 2012. &amp;nbsp;It achieves the best outcomes in the industry with over 10 pounds lost per paid member. &amp;nbsp;How, you ask? &amp;nbsp;Great question! &amp;nbsp;It has:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;* A coaching engine that generates personalized daily tasks &amp;amp; realtime motivational feedback;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The world&amp;rsquo;s most accurate food database, crowd-sourced by users &amp;amp; instantly searchable;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Virtual support groups created using automated clustering technology and tracked using scalable management tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;* A focus on simplicity and friendliness, to make all of the above easy to use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Many more features focused around guidance &amp;amp; motivation for our users&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn how a startup really works on the inside, then Noom is the place for you. We have an incredible amount of transparency, with weekly all-company TGIFs where the wine and the information both flow freely (much to our legal counsel&amp;rsquo;s dismay). &amp;nbsp;Because you&amp;rsquo;ll have equity in the company and have to make many decisions in your work, it&amp;rsquo;s important for you to know what&amp;rsquo;s going on. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have an amazing chef (we love her!) who prepares gourmet lunches every day for all employees (along with afternoon smoothies and random breakfasts and dinners), a lively office with frequent visitors, and a dedicated team who work hard and play hard, with frequent offsites (beach, anyone?) and team outings (from shuffleboard to wine tasting). &amp;nbsp;We also have more cakes than is probably healthy (welcome cakes, birthday cakes, goodbye cakes and cakes just because -- no joke).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus health insurance (100% paid by Noom) and a 401(k). We also have a $200 wellness budget, which you can spend on everything from triathlon registration fees to massages.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 01:08:27 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-09-01T01:08:27Z</a10:updated><location>New York, NY</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/92039/senior-frontend-developer-so1-gmbh</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/92039/senior-frontend-developer-so1-gmbh</link><a10:author><a10:name>So1 GmbH</a10:name></a10:author><category>html5</category><category>css3</category><category>node.js</category><category>jquery</category><category>functional-programming</category><title>Senior Frontend Developer at So1 GmbH (Berlin, Germany)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your role as Senior Frontend Developer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;You will be a part of successful software team and will be responsible for the design, development and improvement of our frontend solutions.

Ultimately, it is all about building efficient systems and tools that enable finance teams to make informed, data-driven decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More about You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;We love developers/analysts who are self-starters, motivated, data-driven, and carry a relaxed yet enthusiastic attitude. You will need to have a BS/BA/IT Degree or equivalent experience with 2+ years of experience managing and deploying process updates and integration services to/on an ERP platform. Your colleagues describe you as a go-to person for challenges around technical integrations architecture, dealing with complex data structure patterns. If you have hands on experience with REST, Web Services, XML, XSLT and working knowledge of scripting languages (Perl/Python/Php/Unix Shell) and ANSI/SQL, then that's a big plus. You bring with you, a good 3-5 years of experience implementing and supporting ERP applications (NetSuite/Oracle/Workday) and have strong hands-on experience with Integrations like SFDC, AvaTax, 3rd Party Middleware (Boomi, Mulesoft, etc.) and off-the-shelf Billing/Revenue Recognition systems. You must have excellent written, verbal and listening communication skills and be able to prioritize and deliver the most important things first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are a good fit if you relish solving challenges, have the ability to see around corners and know whats coming next and your personal mantra is 'bring it on' when faced with a new challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2015 11:08:27 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-08-14T11:08:27Z</a10:updated><location>San Francisco, CA</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/79665/devops-engineer-python-optiver</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/79665/devops-engineer-python-optiver</link><a10:author><a10:name>Optiver</a10:name></a10:author><category>sql</category><category>python</category><category>linux</category><category>unix</category><category>sysadmin</category><title>DevOps Engineer (Python) at Optiver (Amsterdam, Netherlands)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Are you the missing link between our IT Operations and Trading departments?

The position will have the opportunity to evolve into a role in which the person has an equity-stake in the company. The right person will be excited about the dynamic and fast-paced (aka stressful) environment of a startup and view that as a benefit, not a drawback. The startup environment is not for everyone, but for the person who is looking for that sort of life experience, the opportunity to help build something from the ground up where individual contributions make immediate and substantial impacts on the company as a whole can be extremely rewarding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Those interested can find out more about the company, and view some demo videos of our software in actionon our website: www.exaptive.com. We were featured on the front page of the Business Innovation section of The Boston Globe (http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2013/12/cambridge-based_exaptive_wants.html) and in Oklahoma City's The Journal Record (http://www.i2e.org/news/innovators-exaptive-inc/).

Then this might be the right opportunity for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job Mission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a part of ASML&amp;rsquo;s Metrology Software department, you will provide the software solutions that realize the metrology system functions, producing sub-nm measurement and control accuracy. Your solutions emerge from sound software engineering practice and take low effort to develop and maintain. You choose for system-wide experience and drive for successful customer deployment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;ASML&amp;rsquo;s lithography systems deliver nanometer accuracy at high productivity. The required accuracy level cannot be achieved by hardware and mechatronics solutions only. At system level, imperfections of the subsystems need to be measured and corrected. The Metrology Functional Group creates mathematical models describing the lithography machine and its imperfections. The parameters of these models are calibrated using several sensors present in the machine. The calibrations of the machine can be done offline in a dedicated calibration test, or inline while running production. Afterwards, the calibrated parameters are used to control the machine in such a manner that the inaccuracies are corrected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Solutions of the Metrology Functional Group are implemented in software by the Metrology Software Department. Your role is to design, realize and integrate high-quality software engineering solutions, allowing fast and efficient delivery of complex metrology functions. Within the Metrology Software Department, we are reshaping our software architecture to facilitate seamless implementation of the metrology functions in our software. By introducing engineering practices such as Model Driven Engineering, we increase our engineering efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2015 15:08:27 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-08-05T15:08:27Z</a10:updated><location>Veldhoven, Netherlands</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/81615/studio-engineering-director-roblox</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/81615/studio-engineering-director-roblox</link><a10:author><a10:name>ROBLOX</a10:name></a10:author><category>c++</category><category>c</category><category>qt</category><title>Studio Engineering Director at ROBLOX (San Mateo, CA)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;ROBLOX is the largest user-generated content site in video games.

After evaluation of this feedback you might incorporate it in a new iteration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will actively think about technical choices, such as our architecture, tools and processes. Choices that were made in the past are not rules.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You open pull requests, review the code and give feedback that makes your team even better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will perform code-reviews in order to provide feedback that makes your team even better, and to maintain a high level of quality in our code bases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will work in a motivated team to deliver on sprint commitment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will actively improve overall software quality.

Yesterday you and your teammates demoed the work of the former sprint. The round of applause, the future users gave to your team was well deserved, since the WPF application is showing some serious advantages over the current way of working, and is looking very slick to beat. 'Sure', you think, the end result was good, but things could've gone a little better. In the retrospective following the demo you're able to praise the good end result and vent some constructive feedback. After the small replay in your head, you assign the top user story to yourself. The debtors from the financial department want to be able to approve or reject the agreements the purchasers create, in order to be a second set of eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;You walk by the web services team, thinking that for now you're going to have to mock the calls regarding the agreements, but the service containing the functionality has already been released. Attached to the user story is a smooth design, with new icons and storyboards. You spot the use of an element that doesn't exist in our WPF toolkit yet. You're going to take until lunch to decide how you will implement the control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will be working in a dedicated and smart team with three to five other developers, each of them with their own specialization, ranging from XAML, the ins and outs of the upcoming C# 6, Unit tests and somebody who knows Git inside out. Your team will be complemented by a Scrum Master and a Product Owner. Each of these roomies will challenge you, both technically and in a game of Nerf.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2015 09:08:27 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-08-12T09:08:27Z</a10:updated><location>Rotterdam, Netherlands</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/93791/technical-project-manager-scrummaster-rbm-technologies</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/93791/technical-project-manager-scrummaster-rbm-technologies</link><a10:author><a10:name>RBM Technologies</a10:name></a10:author><title>Technical Project Manager/ScrumMaster at RBM Technologies (Boston, MA)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Project Manager/ScrumMaster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBM Technologies has redefined the concept of visual merchandising management through a unique set of web-based solutions and services that optimize in-store execution of campaigns.

Already, we've been a key force in bringing UN statehood recognition to Palestine, passing revolutionary anti-corruption legislation into law in Brazil, smuggling in sat phones to Syria and humanitarian relief into Burma, and so much more. We&amp;rsquo;re nimble, multi-lingual (17 languages and counting!), and fiercely independent (100% funded by small online donations from members). We&amp;rsquo;ve held over 10,000 rallies and events in every country in the world (including the largest climate march in history) and raised over $50 million online. But we&amp;rsquo;ve just scratched the surface of what&amp;rsquo;s possible -- and we need the right Senior Developers to help take Avaaz to the next level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Senior Developer will be a member of the tech leadership within the organisation, and will take on the challenge of creating a modular, service-oriented back-end that will enable us to scale. We are looking for candidates who have intimate familiarity and experience with industry best practices in software engineering. A strong candidate will have expertise in areas including software design, testing, and technical management. They will also support junior developers, and must be excited to train and mentor them to maintain a high level of quality while implementing solutions quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our stack:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Web servers provisioned on AWS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Legacy web application written in PHP with a MySQL storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;New micro-services developed mostly in Python, using MySQL and Big Data storage engines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;New front-end service developed using React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ensure existing and new systems are robust to high traffic, and resilient to failures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ensure that the tech team produces clean, maintainable, extensible, and well-tested software.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ensure that our code and software architecture correctly utilize applicable design patterns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Support our transition to service-oriented architecture through the design, development, and implementation of micro-services.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Support continuous improvements to our engineering processes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Assist with recruitment and developer training, to ensure that all software developers achieve and maintain a high level of skill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mentor more junior developers on their professional journeys within the Organization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lead and oversee the development of new tools as required by the Organization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Avaaz is a virtual organization, with most of our work done over email, telephone and Skype. Our staff are based in cities all over the world and meet at team retreats twice per year. Avaaz covers office costs, either to establish a home office or to rent one, and we support staff to house themselves in local similar organisations when preferred.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compensation and Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Salary varies with location and experience, but is highly competitive with leading non-governmental organizations. Benefits also range with location, but include 5 weeks paid vacation per year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 more reasons to join Avaaz!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. We&amp;rsquo;re winning -- our campaigning works and we&amp;rsquo;re changing politics and practices across the world. Check out our recent victories at http://www.avaaz.org/en/highlights.php. Or see what the world&amp;rsquo;s media is saying about us at http://www.avaaz.org/en/media.php.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Our tactics are bold and effective -- we do what&amp;rsquo;s needed to win campaigns, whether it&amp;rsquo;s pioneering the use of satellite phones and critical technology to support democracy movements or rallying the largest climate protests in history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. The mission is the metric -- large funders don&amp;rsquo;t control our strategy. We work with members to do what&amp;rsquo;s best for the world each and every time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. We thrive in risky situations -- we don&amp;rsquo;t let powerful forces like Rupert Murdoch&amp;rsquo;s media empire bully us with legal, brand or financial threats. We&amp;rsquo;re experts at navigating risk and meeting threats head on, in the media, the courts or on the streets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. We pay sustainable salaries -- our salaries are competitive and we believe in supporting long term commitment to the work we do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;6. Our team is awesome -- it&amp;rsquo;s chock full of brilliant people at the top of their fields in law, politics, civil society and more. We&amp;rsquo;re no drama and a heck of a lot of fun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;7. We have great work-life balance -- it&amp;rsquo;s a professional responsibility and there&amp;rsquo;s huge support to nail it. We believe we all work best when we are rested and enjoying a full life outside of the office.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;8. You can be anywhere -- except for a few roles that require a specific location, our staff can be based anywhere with an airport and a great internet connection. If you want to work from one of our large offices in New York or London, you can do that, or live on an island somewhere!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;9. We&amp;rsquo;re fiercely meritocratic -- our hierarchy is based on judgment and we are constantly checking it against objective standards that are 100% transparent. We believe in the best ideas becoming instantly recognized and adopted, and all jobs and roles are assigned meritocratically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;10. There&amp;rsquo;s no drama -- we work as one team to change the world. You may need to see it to believe it, but we&amp;rsquo;ve got a team where gossip, drama, internal politics and all that draining stuff just doesn't exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2015 16:08:27 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-08-30T16:08:27Z</a10:updated><location>New York, NY</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/94082/lead-visualization-engineer-poll-everywhere</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/94082/lead-visualization-engineer-poll-everywhere</link><a10:author><a10:name>Poll Everywhere</a10:name></a10:author><category>d3.js</category><category>backbone.js</category><category>coffeescript</category><category>javascript</category><title>Lead Visualization Engineer at Poll Everywhere (San Francisco, CA) (allows remote)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;You love the idea of building impactful visualizations that millions of people will experience, live, during presentations, class lectures, or broadcast events.

Here's what we do...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alliants are a bunch of people who care about building the right thing, and building things right. All of our work comes from recommendation, which is why we don&amp;rsquo;t have a sales team. Whether we're building a new startup, growing a large product, coaching in dev processes, designing new tech strategies, or refactoring a large old behemoth, each interaction we have has created more work for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re based in London and Southampton, so if you like the bustle, varied culture and tiny apartments; or instead like the sea, paddle-boarding to work and smell of farms we can accommodate you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were looking for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A company based on recommendation needs people who have pride in what they do. You understand how good design helps mature a system, and have probably read Martin Fowler or Uncle Bob on well designed clean code, you like to keep abreast of what you don&amp;rsquo;t know or use, like new languages like Elixir or Rust. You appreciate the professionalism that TDD (or good tests) affords. You know the trade offs of monolithic architectures and that newer ways, like micro-services, have trade offs too. And ultimately you know that there is no universal correct way of building software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re a knowledge based business - people come to us because we know what to do and how to do it. So we don&amp;rsquo;t hire people to just write programs. We need people who help us build our own knowledge, and do things better. We&amp;rsquo;re not afraid to prototype and give talks on our ideas, and encourage all to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although technical competency is important, we want people passionate about software. We think that passion is visible in our work. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for people of all levels, grads to senior developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We almost always try to be highly agile, goal/data driven, and collaborative. Our clients may not be.

Developers mostly work with JEE platforms (think JBoss, GlassFish or similar), or OSGi containers (think Felix, Karaf, ServiceMix, etc.) that sit behind our cloud infrastructures.

We have certified scrum masters constantly on the lookout for improvements. Our developers are deeply involved in technical details, but we encourage them to build a good understanding of customer&amp;rsquo;s needs and business processes. It&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to see a developer showing a customer how to make an improvement to an existing practice.

De reden is simpel. In levensbedreigende noodsituaties waar iedere seconde telt, is het een enorme uitdaging voor ambulancedienstverleners om binnen enkele minuten op de plaats van bestemming te arriveren en direct te beginnen met het verlenen van de eerste hulp. In Nederland wordt gewerkt met een richtlijn dat 95% van alle levensbedreigende noodsituaties binnen 15 minuten worden bereikt door een ambulance. In de praktijk blijkt dat deze doelstelling structureel niet wordt gehaald door het merendeel van de ambulance dienstverleners. In 7% van de ruim 500.000 levensbedreigende noodritten wordt de aanrijtijd overschreden, wat als gevolg heeft dat in 35.000 gevallen de ambulance te laat arriveert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ons concept is een software-oplossing die ervoor zorgt dat de reactietijd van ambulances verkort kan worden door middel van verschillende Dynamisch Ambulance Management (DAM) algoritmen die ontwikkeld worden door CWI. De gemeenschappelijke deler van deze algoritmen is dat we proactief ambulances binnen hun regio gaan verplaatsen zodat we altijd de optimale dekking van het gebied realiseren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wat kunnen meldkamers en de ambulancedienstverleners bereiken met REPRO/MultiDAM:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;vermindering van de tijd die besteed wordt aan logistieke besluitvorming door de centralist;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;verhoging van de beschikbare tijd voor medische ondersteuning door de centralist;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;elimineren van irrationele menselijke besluitvorming op de inzet van ambulances;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;reductie van de rijtijdoverschrijding;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;gerichte lokale verbetering van de prestaties van bijvoorbeeld 80% naar 85% voor een specifiek postcode gebied;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;een reductie van de kosten door effici&amp;euml;ntere distributie van ambulances;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;optimaliseren van standplaatslocaties om kosten te reduceren.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voor de juiste persoon is dit de ideale kans om ervaring op te doen bij een startend bedrijf en onderdeel uitmaken van een ondernemend team.

The ideal candidate&amp;nbsp;is a "developer's developer" and enjoys reading about programming in their free time, tinkering on the weekends with side projects and staying abreast of the latest frameworks/technologies in their area of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We basically want someone with a passion for development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Required Technology Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;C# Experience - Intermediate to Advanced&amp;nbsp;proficiency&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optional Technology Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;ASP.net MVC&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;LINQ&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Web API&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Azure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Xamarin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;SQL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;ReactiveUI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;WPF&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Javascript Frameworks (Angular,&amp;nbsp;React, ect)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;HTML&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build/Test CI&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work Remote or in Reno, Nevada&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're looking for the best candidate&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;worldwide&lt;/em&gt;. Don't let a little thing like geography get in the way. One&amp;nbsp;third of our team currently&amp;nbsp;works remotely. It works very well with the help of Slack, Screen Hero,&amp;nbsp;Basecamp, and Github.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do require you to be able to make our 1pm pacific time standup and have at least a four hour overlap with our 8-5pm mon-fri Reno office hours at least four days a week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, we have an Australian employee who works from noon to 9pm pacific time Sunday through Thursday&amp;nbsp;(that's his mon-fri). That works just fine for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job&amp;nbsp;Salary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let us know what you want to get paid when you submit your resume.&amp;nbsp;We want experienced and proficient&amp;nbsp;engineers.

We've found that the best way to find great engineers is to actually have them code, not just answer trivia questions during an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why we require applications to do a refactoring exercise as part of their job submission. The right candidate&amp;nbsp;won't find this a pain in the ass; it should be enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also weeds out the vast majority of candidates&amp;nbsp;who just fire off resumes everywhere. In our previous job posting, 90% of candidates&amp;nbsp;did NOT do this step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The refactoring exercise is attached to this job posting. It has a readme.txt in it with instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excited about our Company?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In your application let us know why you want to work with us and why you think you'd be a good fit for our company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAQs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do I have to be a cyclist to apply?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nope! We'll encourage you to ride, and will even buy you an entry level bike if you want, but it's not required. Not everyone in the company is a cyclist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What's unlimited vacation mean?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't keep track of vacation hours. The CEO of TrainerRoad used to be an engineer at a Fortune 500 company where life was a grind. We believe employees put out their best work when they are happy and not burnt out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're brain just isn't working at 3pm, we encourage employees to go home and rest up. It does no one any good to sit and stare at the computer screen for another two hours. We don't track that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees generally shoot for around four weeks of REAL vacation time (no e-mail checking) but some take more and some take less. &amp;nbsp;The thing we care about is how productive you can be and how much value you can add to the company. Bottom line, we want people who are passionate and get things done. If you meet those requirements everything else works itself out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, if you end up taking massive amounts of vacation, come in late, leave early and aren't producing outstanding work we're going to have a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you work?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We try to work as pragmaticly as we can. &amp;nbsp;We have excellent designers on staff who go from mockups to responsive HTML with light javascript work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Development uses Github with a strict&amp;nbsp;pull request process. We test, comment, refactor and improve each other's pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have partial test coverage and we can definitely improve in that area (maybe you can help?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often pair program via Screen Hero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our developers float between mobile, desktop and web development. Our future engineers can specialize&amp;nbsp;in one area if that's where their passion is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You didn't ask about education, what's required?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please put your education on your resume, but we're not going to reject someone because they don't have a degree in Computer Science. We understand that some of the best and most passionate&amp;nbsp;engineers are self taught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the longest job posting ever, when does it end?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now! Congrats if you made it this far! We look forward to looking at your resume and refactoring exercise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2015 21:08:27 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-08-12T21:08:27Z</a10:updated><location>Reno, NV</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/85279/devops-engineer-cake-solutions-inc</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/85279/devops-engineer-cake-solutions-inc</link><a10:author><a10:name>Cake Solutions Inc</a10:name></a10:author><category>amazon-web-services</category><category>jvm</category><category>nosql</category><category>cassandra</category><category>linux</category><title>DevOps Engineer at Cake Solutions Inc (NY, NY)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Cake Solutions Inc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the very latest technologies, Cake Solutions helps organisations take innovative and disruptive ideas and develop them into reactive software solutions.
