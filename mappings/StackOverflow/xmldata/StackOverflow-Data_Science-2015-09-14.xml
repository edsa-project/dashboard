Today, our proprietary cloud platform includes the industry-leading electronic medical record for oncology, a first-of-its-kind analytics tool, patient portal, and integrated billing management.&amp;nbsp;Ultimately, our goal is to help cancer centers leverage real-world oncology data, at a scale and clinical depth never before seen, to transform how cancer care is delivered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our engineering team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our engineering team builds and runs data processing pipelines, algorithmic and human-operated data curation tools, and customer-facing data analytics and visualization products. We build systems that clean, structure and understand clinical-level patient data as we build the largest, most comprehensive set of oncology data intelligence. We scale pipelines to handle the world's oncology data with creative engineering solutions to open-ended oncology data problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data pipeline takes in full clinical patient records and produces normalized, high-fidelity, queryable data that is ready to be mined for medical and operational insights. We&amp;rsquo;ve built a unified data set that is unparalleled in its depth and accuracy, and which gives our partners the capability to ask questions about data that weren't answerable until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We work in a fast-paced, high-information-volume environment with complex domain challenges, which means context is key and there's always more to learn and soak up. We want to know oncology data cold &amp;mdash; better than anyone else in the industry &amp;mdash; and we believe doing so requires building a culture where we all like coming to work each day. In our culture, decisions are transparent and data-driven, and people are empowered to make waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backend Software Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br

And we laugh &amp;ndash; all the time. You'll get the opportunity to work at an institution pushing the boundaries of open data transparency, while collaborating with some of the industry&amp;rsquo;s brightest engineers and data scientists to devise, nurture, and implement cutting-edge solutions to continuously evolving engineering obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Position&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Willy Wonka said &amp;ldquo;We are the dreamers of dreams.&amp;rdquo; Well, FiscalNote front-end engineers are the architects that make our open data dreams come true. Wild ambition isn&amp;rsquo;t lacking at FiscalNote, and only the most talented can visualize open-data products that have never been built before. Our front-end engineers love what they do, and they are on a mission to continuously improve upon and build the most beautiful and useful user interfaces the open data world has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Creative. Ambitious. Communicative. Driven. &amp;nbsp;You yearn to exercise your abilities in a greater capacity than on a tiny feature of a much larger product. Lending your talents across our entire stack, you not only love sharing your savvy with the team, but also crave the opportunity to absorb any and all knowledge from our hyper-collaborative environment. Your appreciation (bordering on obsession) for clean code and attention to detail have helped you shine brightly at previous positions. You&amp;rsquo;re tickled by the idea of implementing inventive uses of older technologies, but even more revved at the idea of leveraging the most modern front-end tools, frameworks, and languages. Most of all, though, you live to engineer creative interfaces that take the user experience to a whole new level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;- 2+ years of industry experience programming in JavaScript&lt;br&gt;- Expertise with HTML5 and CSS3&lt;br&gt;- Expertise with jQuery&lt;br&gt;- Knowledge of algorithms, data structures and Object Oriented programming&lt;br&gt;- Knowledge of and experience with JavaScript MV* frameworks.

More importantly, though, is the opportunity to develop software that impacts real decisions -- decisions that substantially affect governing in the US and abroad. You will hone your engineering skills among peers just as motivated and skilled as you are, and in the process, develop a tight-knit camaraderie that will transcend simple software development.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 05 Sep 2015 14:43:33 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-09-05T14:43:33Z</a10:updated><location>Washington, DC</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/71600/software-engineer-elasticsearch-data-tenable-network-security</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/71600/software-engineer-elasticsearch-data-tenable-network-security</link><a10:author><a10:name>Tenable Network Security</a10:name></a10:author><category>elasticsearch</category><category>rabbitmq</category><category>cassandra</category><category>go</category><category>amazon-web-services</category><title>Software Engineer - ElasticSearch / Data Processing at Tenable Network Security (New York, NY) (allows remote)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Tenable now has over 400 employees globally and 20,000 customers in 150 countries.

You should know javascript and some javascript libraries like jQuery, D3, etc, and have an interest in data visualization, data science, and internet technologies. Most importantly, you should be hungry to build big, important applications that matter, and looking for projects to flex your newly developed coding muscles on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Experience with a variety of different internet technologies would be a bonus, but not necessary - we view this very much as a learn-on-the-job type position and as a result are valuing smarts, motivation and desire-to-learn over experience. These positions will be based in downtown OKC, but with the opportunity for travel to Exaptive's Boston and Vancouver locations. The position will have the opportunity to evolve into a role in which the person has an equity-stake in the company. The right person will be excited about the dynamic and fast-paced (aka stressful) environment of a startup and view that as a benefit, not a drawback. The startup environment is not for everyone, but for the person who is looking for that sort of life experience, the opportunity to help build something from the ground up where individual contributions make immediate and substantial impacts on the company as a whole can be extremely rewarding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Those interested can find out more about the company, and view some demo videos of our software in actionon our website: www.exaptive.com.

The Tableau Mobile team has been tasked with a single mission: to make the mobile experience the most delightful way for our customers to stay on top of their data. We build next-generation apps for iOS and Android for consumers and enterprises alike, and ensure quality through a variety of modern, innovative techniques, including white-box automation, data-driven pair-wise testing, and instrumentation tools.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Platform:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a member of one of our platform teams you&amp;rsquo;ll work on Tableau&amp;rsquo;s secret sauce. We are about connecting, querying, integrating and preparing data from nearly 50 different data sources. We are about calculations and statistical analytics. We are about first class test frameworks and more. Ideal candidates will be skilled in one or more programming language, for example Python, C++, C# or Java. Working knowledge of one or more database technology like SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, DB2, Hadoop or Apache Spark is preferred.

We are now expanding our Oklahoma City team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We are looking for an experience security architect that has designed scaleable and secure web application, and is also comfortable performing penetration testing and security analysis of systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Some of the challenges of designing the Exaptive platform is that its goal is to be extended by third-party components, and those components will be bought and sold in a component store much like the Apple app store. This opens up opportunities for malicious code as well as introducing the complexity of financial transaction processing. On top of that, Exaptive frequently gets used for data science in fields that have confidential and proprietary data. So we're looking for someone with experience designing architectures that can deal with these things - someone with experience designing sandbox systems for large-scale multi-user environments, with financial transaction processsing applications, and with designing systems with secure data handling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This position will be based in downtown OKC, but with the opportunity for travel to Exaptive's Boston and Vancouver locations. The position will have the opportunity to evolve into a role in which the person has an equity-stake in the company. The right person will be excited about the dynamic and fast-paced (aka stressful) environment of a startup and view that as a benefit, not a drawback. The startup environment is not for everyone, but for the person who is looking for that sort of life experience, the opportunity to help build something from the ground up where individual contributions make immediate and substantial impacts on the company as a whole can be extremely rewarding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Those interested can find out more about the company, and view some demo videos of our software in actionon our website: www.exaptive.com. We were featured on the front page of the Business Innovation section of The Boston Globe (http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2013/12/cambridge-based_exaptive_wants.html) and in Oklahoma City's The Journal Record (http://www.i2e.org/news/innovators-exaptive-inc/). Our Founder and CEO, Dave King, has been invited internationally to present our work.

We are now expanding our Oklahoma City team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We are looking for an infrastructure architect that has experience designing complex web-application architectures, is familiar with a wide variety of technologies, and knows how to pick the right technology for the job. Exaptive is more than just a data analytics platform. It's a complete ecosystem for data science - that means it is comprised of a bunch of different pieces that all have to work together. There is the web-based development environment, the Xap Store, and the Cognitive Network. Each component introduces its own set of infrastructure requirements. In addition, we have a consulting branch of the business which sometimes needs infrastructure design decisions in response to unique custom client requirements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This position will be based in downtown OKC, but with the opportunity for travel to Exaptive's Boston and Vancouver locations. The position will have the opportunity to evolve into a role in which the person has an equity-stake in the company. The right person will be excited about the dynamic and fast-paced (aka stressful) environment of a startup and view that as a benefit, not a drawback. The startup environment is not for everyone, but for the person who is looking for that sort of life experience, the opportunity to help build something from the ground up where individual contributions make immediate and substantial impacts on the company as a whole can be extremely rewarding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Those interested can find out more about the company, and view some demo videos of our software in actionon our website: www.exaptive.com. We were featured on the front page of the Business Innovation section of The Boston Globe (http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2013/12/cambridge-based_exaptive_wants.html) and in Oklahoma City's The Journal Record (http://www.i2e.org/news/innovators-exaptive-inc/). Our Founder and CEO, Dave King, has been invited internationally to present our work. You can see a video of a presentation he recently gave to the Oklahoma Venture Forum about Exaptive's big-picture vision on our website.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If you don't currently live in Oklahoma City, you should check out what this up-and-coming city has to offer: a burgeoning tech startup and creative sector, the largest food truck event in the nation, olympic rowing facilities, and a cost of living that can't be beat. For the right candidate we'll pay relocation costs.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2015 18:43:33 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-08-25T18:43:33Z</a10:updated><location>Oklahoma City, OK</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/94509/software-engineering-manager-amazon</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/94509/software-engineering-manager-amazon</link><a10:author><a10:name>Amazon</a10:name></a10:author><category>c</category><category>c++</category><category>java</category><category>linux</category><category>perl</category><title>Software Engineering Manager at Amazon (Dallas, TX)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Why are Software Engineers important at Amazon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Amazon, we hire the best minds in technology to innovate and build for the benefit of our customers.

We plan on building this company for decades to come, and while we love rapid iteration where it makes sense, we also take the time to make farsighted architectural decisions and place great emphasis on code quality over raw speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe in the power of highly motivated and capable individuals to accomplish great things in small teams, with end-to-end ownership of projects and rapid iteration.

Were you the kid that took apart the family TV not just to see how it worked but because you thought you could make it better? Can you detect and prevent the invasion of bugs better than the Orkin man? &amp;nbsp;If you answered yes to any/all of these, then you really need to be a Software Development Engineer in Test at Rackspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the largest OpenStack public cloud in the business and our commitment to provide our customers the best platform to continue changing the world, the life of an SDET at the Rack can be quite unique and rewarding. How is this possible? Easy&amp;mdash;we help match your passions, birthday wishes, and Sherlock skills with the right opportunity to be GREAT. Here&amp;rsquo;s a preview to get you started:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing the Limits of the Cloud:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;OpenStack&amp;hellip;heard of it? Yep we worked with NASA as founders so of course we have some of the most notable upstream contributors on the planet. Whether for our public or private cloud offerings, our Devs are pounding out code in Python, Ruby, Java or whatever&amp;rsquo;s the next big thing at a break-neck pace. So when it comes to SDETs, we take pride in being true partners in excellence; not some robot or second-tier Dev whose only task is to cross off test cases from a checklist. Our SDETs have a tinker&amp;rsquo;s mind with a natural curiosity to know where we are going and to anticipate the unexpected. Diversity drives innovation so our teams are dispersed across the globe&amp;mdash;even working from their favorite Cheetos-stained gaming chair at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal Innovation:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Ten data centers around the globe with several hundred thousand servers that all need to seamlessly interact like one of your LAN parties back in college. If you like HUGE environments then jump on into this playground. Our DevOps Engineers, Software Developers, and Infrastructure Engineers have to keep up with the demands of the industry that didn&amp;rsquo;t exist, oh maybe 5 minutes ago. &amp;nbsp;Our SDETs who partner with these teams are literally building their dreams to insure what&amp;rsquo;s new today is built to withstand the strains of tomorrow. Bulletproof code&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s how we roll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is NOT your uncle&amp;rsquo;s Quality Engineering team where there was a lack of software development to accomplish testing and the job was just about manual button pushing. Are you ready to change the game doing what they said can&amp;rsquo;t be done? Are you ready to automate bigger things better and faster? What are you waiting for? Click that apply button, talk with one of our talent specialists and get ready to jump on in to the best adventure you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still not convinced? Hear from the Rackers who do this day in and day out but still can&amp;rsquo;t believe this is their job. &lt;a title="QE at the Rack" href="http://youtu.be/LhoEa7Ag8Xw"&gt;QE at the Rack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Aug 2015 04:43:33 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-08-29T04:43:33Z</a10:updated><location>Windcrest, TX</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/90165/senior-software-developer-application-smartsheet</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/90165/senior-software-developer-application-smartsheet</link><a10:author><a10:name>Smartsheet</a10:name></a10:author><category>java</category><category>.net</category><category>ruby</category><category>python</category><category>javascript</category><title>Senior Software Developer, Application Integrations at Smartsheet (Bellevue, WA)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Love building awesome apps, integrations and API-based mashups?&amp;nbsp; Want to help shape and grow a new developer community?&amp;nbsp; Smartsheet is taking collaboration by storm with a product loved by 6M+ users in over 189 countries.&amp;nbsp; Join the Platform Team on its quest for world domination, help break down barriers between services, build apps that make you proud, and have fun doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are a passionate engineer who likes variety and wants to touch many products and technologies, you will fit right in with the Platform Team. &amp;nbsp;From day one, you will write shippable code and make contributions across the board - from building rock-solid production integrations with Google, JIRA and Salesforce to experimental data visualizations and mashups, cool workflows with DocuSign and Evernote.

You have fixed a bug in a de-serialisation method that was causing metadata to leak from JSON objects. Considering the large amount of simultaneous, relatively small requests these services process, Node.js seemed the obvious choice. So you had to abandon your usual work field of PHP and give the old Javascript another chance. Once again it proved itself a powerful language, capable of building beautiful stuff.

Our products are constantly evolving with our client needs - we are not simply maintaining existing products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;em&gt;full SDLC&lt;/em&gt; development position. The candidate must be willing to take on all aspects of the development process, and be ready to support applications in production environments. He/she may be asked to test code sets, document software, and implement products and related solutions. Strong knowledge of design patterns and software development best practices must be shown at all times. A high degree of creativity and motivation is required of the successful candidate, who is expected to operate with limited direct supervision. This developer needs to have a willingness to do whatever it takes to make the products and the company successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO WORK FOR NAVIS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;NAVIS was a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;finalist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2015 Oregon Tech Awards Technology Company of the Year &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;in the Growth category!-&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.navisblog.com/navis-finalist-in-the-15-oregon-tech-awards-technology-company-of-the-year-growth/%C2%A0" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.navisblog.com/navis-finalist-in-the-15-oregon-tech-awards-technology-company-of-the-year&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;NAVIS is growing fast due to high market demand for our products.

Whether it's re-imagining how SaaS is implemented and scaled, blameless postmortems, pushing to production on your very first day, we don't subscribe to the mantra of "Because we've always done it that way".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that small, empowered, self-motivated teams can do big things. We also believe in the right tool for the job, not language-as-religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Job&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a database and data store administrator, you will be part of a team of highly-skilled engineers that manage all production, test and ancillary data environments. &amp;nbsp;While there are a number of different systems, Rally is consolidating to MongoDB and Oracle as the primary data systems. &amp;nbsp;This position will be focused on MongoDB first, and Oracle second, and will be expected to cross-train the other DBAs on MongoDB best practices, management and implementation. &amp;nbsp;The position requires on-call availability to support our 24x7x365 SaaS operations. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring and administering data systems security in AWS and colo environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing data stored in the databases and data stores and making recommendations relating to performance and efficiency of that data storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helping application programmers to efficiently utilize the data assets by assisting in database schema design and recommending the best design for scalability and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proactively monitor systems for optimum performance and capacity constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Establishing standards and best practices for database backup and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;2+ years of production Oracle DBA experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;3+ years of production MongoDB management experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experience with Oracle RDBMS running on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experience managing, implementing, monitoring and scaling MongoDB in AWS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong experience supporting mission critical data infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experience and knowledge of an Oracle 11g database for an OLTP application in areas such as best practices, scalability, performance, and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experience with Oracle and/or MongoDB performance tuning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experience with Oracle standby databases.

Hierbij geef jij op testgebied concrete invulling aan de sprintplanning. Je denkt daarbij fundamenteel na over het testen van deze complexe software en volgt de nieuwste ontwikkelingen op testgebied. Je zoekt de ontwikkelaars op om in een vroeg stadium testplannen te ontwikkelen en verwerkt deze tot uitvoerbare tests. Daarnaast zet jij het proces op voor het uitvoeren van acceptatietests, co&amp;ouml;rdineer je de testactiviteiten en voert deze ook zelf uit.

Our futures and options product makes discoverability of such securities easy, which proves to be a very important for our clients in a dynamic environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Economics group puts the fundamentals of our economy in front of hundreds of thousands of clients every day.

The product allows for clear understanding of vast global data sets spanning 30+ years, big data analytics, real-time alerting and complex financial data. We build applications for discovering and analyzing market trends, aggregating and evaluating analyst predictions, and screening and back-testing investment ideas.

Our responsibilities include communication tools such as Bloomberg's proprietary Email and Instant Message products, Notes and Contact Management systems, News, Market Alerts and Monitoring applications. These are delivered across both desktop and mobile platforms. Our products are built to handle high volume, low latency and high availability. In addition, we build the core systems that form the foundation of applications built by other software groups within Bloomberg.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have a deep understanding of our product areas and work closely with our business counterparts and UX design teams to deliver the experience desired by our customers. As the speed of change is rapid we need people who are agile and eager to learn and develop new skills. The ability to collaborate across multiple teams and learn a depth and breadth of technical and domain knowledge is critical.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;We frequently work with open source software and encourage interaction with the wider technology community by contributing changes and taking part in related meet-ups and conferences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teams in Communication, News, and Realtime Applications and Services:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bloomberg Chat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bloomberg Chat is Bloomberg's instant messaging system.

The Internet Message system converts messages between email and Bloomberg's proprietary Message format. Software written by the team must be scalable, fault tolerant and secure. Our work also includes evolving and extending our solutions for detecting spam, malware and phishing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Contact Management - Bloomberg's most popular functions are its communication tools (Message and Chat). Users of these systems need a fast, secure and reliable way to store their contact information. The Bloomberg contact management system contains data on over 50 million contacts, all of which can be queried in under a millisecond. In the last 12 months, we developed a brand new interface, which we continue to evolve. Our focus this year is our backend systems as we work on improving performance and scalability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Notes - Notes is an exciting new product being developed to further improve the collaboration capabilities of the Bloomberg system. It will enable users to annotate and curate Bloomberg content for quick retrieval and organization, providing insightful ways to analyze user-generated content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mobile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Mobile team has the charge to take Bloomberg's key financial and foundational applications and deliver them to all major mobile platforms.

The team also develops the Bloomberg News Automation suite, which generates thousands of news stories per day with minimal latency, which is triggered by realtime Bloomberg market data and events.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;News Search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;The News Search team owns the search and alerting backend behind the news functionality across Bloomberg. This is one of the most widely used functions on the Bloomberg Terminal. It serves timely, accurate and market moving news to our customers by sifting through hundreds of millions of news stories. Our customers can search, analyze and set alerts for the news that matters to them in milliseconds. Developers work on scalable, low-latency solutions by making use of search and information retrieval technologies, and working with distributed systems running on dedicated farms of machines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Realtime Applications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alerts - The Alert product lets market participants monitor the markets. It exposes nearly every tick in the world, along with a broad range of non-pricing data from corporate actions to social media sentiment and even power station outages. The system is available 24/7 and is used by tens of thousands of traders and investors helping them respond quickly to changing market conditions. Alerts are a major strategic focus for the company and we are scaling our infrastructure and extending our feature set significantly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Monitors - The Monitors team is responsible for providing industry-leading, comprehensive, fully custom cross-asset quote sheet applications. 200,000 of our clients rely on these applications every day.

We build and nurture an Analytics API that processes user data and queries around the clock, across diverse industries. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s gaming, e-commerce, advertising, publishing, or IoT, our platform aims to make Analytics so easy for developers that they can focus entirely on their product. Every day, every week, every month our challenge is to scale with a constantly growing data deluge and evolve along with our user&amp;rsquo;s needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;About the Platform Team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We work together in a pretty novel fashion - servant leaders are elected from the team, by the team. Responsibilities normally held by a single manager are separated across multiple roles. We have very open discussions about our shared priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re always iterating on how we work and what we build. We&amp;rsquo;re growing fast and we know that what worked a year ago won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily work a year from now. This applies both to the technology and the organizations of our teams. We want to provide the best analytics experience for developers and co-create the best work environment for each other - willingness to evolve is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;About the Job&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;By centralizing a data pipeline for hundreds of companies, we operate at a scale that none of them have to worry about. Looking to the horizon, we need to look at every piece of our infrastructure with a critical eye. We need to stay ahead of the curve. You will help us be thoughtful and deliberate about tackling the right bottlenecks at the right time. You&amp;rsquo;ll help make working on the platform easier and easier. You&amp;rsquo;ll have the opportunity to gain deep understanding of distributed systems and teach others! Most importantly, you&amp;rsquo;ll collaborate with some pretty amazing humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2015 18:43:33 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-08-20T18:43:33Z</a10:updated><location>San Francisco, CA</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/96631/senior-software-engineer-aspnet-c-sharp-frontiers</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/96631/senior-software-engineer-aspnet-c-sharp-frontiers</link><a10:author><a10:name>Frontiers</a10:name></a10:author><category>asp.net</category><category>c#</category><category>sql-server</category><category>agile</category><category>rest</category><title>Senior Software Engineer ASP.NET C# at Frontiers (Lausanne, Switzerland)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a senior software engineer ASP.NET to join our Software Engineering team and take responsibility for one remote development team.&lt;br&gt;Your primary responsibilities include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lead the offshore development team to implement technical and functional improvements to our website and the integration of third party products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify opportunities to improve and accelerate the Frontiers platform, both technically and functionally, and coach the team in new technologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deep dive in performance and quality improvements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focus on delivering and maintaining an excellent user experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2015 07:43:33 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-08-31T07:43:33Z</a10:updated><location>Lausanne, Switzerland</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/97213/cyber-and-technology-specialists-dstl</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/97213/cyber-and-technology-specialists-dstl</link><a10:author><a10:name>DSTL</a10:name></a10:author><title>Cyber and Technology Specialists at DSTL (Porton Down, UK)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serve your country.

Hansken draait op een gedistribueerde omgeving en verwerkt vele terabytes aan data per uur. Het analyseren van deze data kan miljoenen relevante sporen opleveren, denk&amp;nbsp; aan e-mails, chatberichten en GPS-co&amp;ouml;rdinaten. Door nieuwe technologische ontwikkelingen blijft het een uitdaging om steeds nieuwe typen forensische sporen doorzoekbaar te maken of slimme analyses toe te voegen, zoals entiteitextractie voor herkenning van kentekens, IBAN-nummers of adressen. Naast het dienen van een belangrijk maatschappelijk belang is Hansken ook een technisch zeer uitdagend project waar je telkens met nieuwe technieken in aanraking komt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Als forensisch software architect ben jij voor Hansken de persoon die de wensen van stakeholders vertaalt naar concrete oplossingen. Je bent communicatief sterk en kunt Hansken uiteenzetten aan klanten en het management. Samen met ontwikkelaars beoordeel je nieuwe technologie&amp;euml;n en frameworks op toepasbaarheid in de huidige architectuur. Vervolgens zorg je dat deze gebruikt worden. Je trekt de kar bij het besluitvormingsproces over gebruikte technologie en (technische) ontwerpbeslissingen op abstract niveau. Hierbij neem je onderbouwd besluiten en verdedig je deze. Bovendien leg je de architectuur vast en bewaak je deze.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Daarnaast ben je verantwoordelijk voor de kwaliteit van Hansken.
