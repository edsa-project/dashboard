And we laugh &amp;ndash; all the time. You'll get the opportunity to work at an institution pushing the boundaries of open data transparency, while collaborating with some of the industry&amp;rsquo;s brightest engineers and data scientists to devise, nurture, and implement cutting-edge solutions to continuously evolving engineering obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Position&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Willy Wonka said &amp;ldquo;We are the dreamers of dreams.&amp;rdquo; Well, FiscalNote front-end engineers are the architects that make our open data dreams come true. Wild ambition isn&amp;rsquo;t lacking at FiscalNote, and only the most talented can visualize open-data products that have never been built before. Our front-end engineers love what they do, and they are on a mission to continuously improve upon and build the most beautiful and useful user interfaces the open data world has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Creative. Ambitious. Communicative. Driven. &amp;nbsp;You yearn to exercise your abilities in a greater capacity than on a tiny feature of a much larger product. Lending your talents across our entire stack, you not only love sharing your savvy with the team, but also crave the opportunity to absorb any and all knowledge from our hyper-collaborative environment. Your appreciation (bordering on obsession) for clean code and attention to detail have helped you shine brightly at previous positions. You&amp;rsquo;re tickled by the idea of implementing inventive uses of older technologies, but even more revved at the idea of leveraging the most modern front-end tools, frameworks, and languages. Most of all, though, you live to engineer creative interfaces that take the user experience to a whole new level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;- 2+ years of industry experience programming in JavaScript&lt;br&gt;- Expertise with HTML5 and CSS3&lt;br&gt;- Expertise with jQuery&lt;br&gt;- Knowledge of algorithms, data structures and Object Oriented programming&lt;br&gt;- Knowledge of and experience with JavaScript MV* frameworks. Ember.js is highly recommended.&lt;br&gt;- Undergraduate and/or graduate degree in engineering, computer science, or related technical field (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Preferred&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;)&lt;br&gt;- Proficient with Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, or related design software (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Preferred&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;)&lt;br&gt;- UI/UX design experience (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Ideal&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In becoming a FiscalNoter, you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy a plethora of benefits that you would expect at both an established company and at a startup. More importantly, though, is the opportunity to develop software that impacts real decisions -- decisions that substantially affect governing in the US and abroad. You will hone your engineering skills among peers just as motivated and skilled as you are, and in the process, develop a tight-knit camaraderie that will transcend simple software development.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 05 Sep 2015 14:43:41 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-09-05T14:43:41Z</a10:updated><location>Washington, DC</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/90962/data-architect-twilio</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/90962/data-architect-twilio</link><a10:author><a10:name>Twilio</a10:name></a10:author><category>java</category><category>security</category><category>agile</category><category>amazon-web-services</category><category>sql</category><title>Data Architect at Twilio (San Francisco, CA)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Twilio Architecture team is responsible for the architecture of Twilio&amp;rsquo;s platform.

We've built our own online platform for engaging with people in crisis (think: suicide, self-harm, domestic violence, etc) over SMS using standard, open web technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we work:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fail intelligently.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We're always do our absolute best work, but we're ready to fail at any moment so we build with redundancy and fault-tolerance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick the right tool.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Technology is a means, not an end.

Bij dit R&amp;amp;D-project wordt gewerkt volgens een agile ontwikkelproces, met moderne ontwikkeltools die goed op elkaar aansluiten.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Als forensisch software engineer big data ontwikkel je samen met een team van ongeveer 8 collega&amp;rsquo;s het platform Hansken verder om onder meer de performance, schaalbaarheid en functionaliteit te verbeteren. Aan het systeem worden hoge eisen aan de kwaliteit en betrouwbaarheid gesteld. Daarom ben je kritisch over het functioneren ervan, durf je vragen te stellen en sta je open voor feedback. Naast je werk aan het systeem denk je mee over het continu verbeteren van het ontwikkelproces, waarbij de forensische kennis zo goed mogelijk geborgd wordt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2015 13:43:41 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-08-21T13:43:41Z</a10:updated><location>The Hague, Netherlands</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/96049/senior-tester-forensische-big-data-rijksoverheid</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/96049/senior-tester-forensische-big-data-rijksoverheid</link><a10:author><a10:name>Rijksoverheid</a10:name></a10:author><category>jbehave</category><title>Senior tester forensische big data at Rijksoverheid (The Hague, Netherlands)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Senior tester forensische big data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nederlands Forensisch Instituut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Functieomschrijving&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ben jij een ervaren tester met kennis van big dataoplossingen?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Je bewaakt bij de groep Software Engineering van het Nederlands Forensisch Instituut (NFI) de kwaliteit van het forensisch big data platform Hansken. Hiervoor ontwikkel je testen en voert ze uit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hansken wordt binnen en buiten het NFI gebruikt voor opsporing en bewijsvoering van ernstige misdrijven als kindermisbruik, moord, grootschalige fraude en andere delicten met grote maatschappelijke impact. Het platform draait op een gedistribueerde omgeving en verwerkt vele terabytes aan data per uur. Het analyseren van deze data kan miljoenen relevante sporen opleveren. Denk aan e-mails, chatberichten, GPS-co&amp;ouml;rdinaten en dergelijke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Door nieuwe technologische ontwikkelingen blijft het een uitdaging om steeds nieuwe typen forensische sporen doorzoekbaar te maken of slimme analyses toe te voegen, zoals entiteitextractie voor herkenning van kentekens, IBAN-nummers of adressen. Als senior tester forensische big data geef jij invulling aan al het benodigde testwerk, waarbij je de functionaliteit van Hansken en de forensische integriteit van de resultaten waarborgt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bij Hansken wordt gewerkt volgens een agile ontwikkelproces, met moderne ontwikkeltools die goed op elkaar aansluiten. Hierbij geef jij op testgebied concrete invulling aan de sprintplanning. Je denkt daarbij fundamenteel na over het testen van deze complexe software en volgt de nieuwste ontwikkelingen op testgebied. Je zoekt de ontwikkelaars op om in een vroeg stadium testplannen te ontwikkelen en verwerkt deze tot uitvoerbare tests. Daarnaast zet jij het proces op voor het uitvoeren van acceptatietests, co&amp;ouml;rdineer je de testactiviteiten en voert deze ook zelf uit. Je rapporteert de testresultaten aan het team en benadrukt pijnpunten.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Om Hansken continu te kunnen blijven verbeteren, zorg jij er met de ontwikkelaars voor dat testplannen worden omgezet in geautomatiseerde tests. Voor het geautomatiseerd testen van onze applicaties gebruiken wij op dit moment het test framework JBehave in combinatie met de Selenium web driver. Deze tests maken onderdeel uit van een continuous delivery proces, waarbij we vanuit onze issue tracker met 1 druk op de knop Hansken kunnen bouwen, testen en uitrollen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2015 13:43:41 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-08-21T13:43:41Z</a10:updated><location>The Hague, Netherlands</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/96254/senior-data-engineer-new-relic</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/96254/senior-data-engineer-new-relic</link><a10:author><a10:name>New Relic</a10:name></a10:author><category>jvm</category><category>kafka</category><category>aws</category><category>java</category><category>nio</category><title>Senior Data Engineer at New Relic (Portland, OR)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;We are&amp;nbsp;seeking a Senior Software Engineer to help build and maintain the high-performance, high-volume services that receive, process, and store the tidal wave of incoming real-time data from thousands of customers and enables our entire line of products. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Researching storage solutions, developing low-latency fault-tolerant architectures, and implementing state-of-the-art distributed query algorithms is our bread-and-butter.

You really do need to be an ace for this. Our engineers are particularly smart, creative, hard-working, and capable collaborators. They need leadership, not supervision. Management at NR leads by example. Managers here help engineers ship great features by providing resources, eliminating blockers, and keeping folks informed. If you're a command-and-control person, this is not the right place for you.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've been a software engineer yourself, and you love helping other engineers excel and manage projects working with engineers and business users, we might be the perfect place. &amp;nbsp; Management here is serious business. We have the best management-mentoring program in any start-up -- perhaps the best, period. It is hard work. Your job as an engineering manager is to pave the way for engineers to do great things and lead projects across organizations. That could mean sitting in meetings so that engineers don't have to; it could mean working with other leaders to keep focus and without repeated changes helping engineers to stay focus and deliver; it could mean coaching an engineer all night through their first big conference presentation. It means whatever it takes to help our engineers ship great features, constantly level up--and have fun doing it! (Of course, you'll have fun too.) &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tell us about your management philosophy in your cover letter and give examples of your risk-reward thinking with releases.

Hansken draait op een gedistribueerde omgeving en verwerkt vele terabytes aan data per uur. Het analyseren van deze data kan miljoenen relevante sporen opleveren, denk&amp;nbsp; aan e-mails, chatberichten en GPS-co&amp;ouml;rdinaten. Door nieuwe technologische ontwikkelingen blijft het een uitdaging om steeds nieuwe typen forensische sporen doorzoekbaar te maken of slimme analyses toe te voegen, zoals entiteitextractie voor herkenning van kentekens, IBAN-nummers of adressen. Naast het dienen van een belangrijk maatschappelijk belang is Hansken ook een technisch zeer uitdagend project waar je telkens met nieuwe technieken in aanraking komt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Als forensisch software architect ben jij voor Hansken de persoon die de wensen van stakeholders vertaalt naar concrete oplossingen.

Samen met ontwikkelaars beoordeel je nieuwe technologie&amp;euml;n en frameworks op toepasbaarheid in de huidige architectuur. Vervolgens zorg je dat deze gebruikt worden. Je trekt de kar bij het besluitvormingsproces over gebruikte technologie en (technische) ontwerpbeslissingen op abstract niveau. Hierbij neem je onderbouwd besluiten en verdedig je deze. Bovendien leg je de architectuur vast en bewaak je deze.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Daarnaast ben je verantwoordelijk voor de kwaliteit van Hansken.

We don't over-engineer and also don't under-engineer -- just the right tool for the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We take great pride in our code because we all want to innovate quickly. We build everything from Android software to C++ image recognition, from web UI to pedometer data analysis. Our apps operate off-line, and we have built lots of client-side infrastructure to lazily load and sync data with the server. This allows us to keep the server side relatively simple while still serving millions of users: Spring/Flask, Spring MVC, mySQL/Mongo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We run Hadoop-based machine learning to find out what makes people stick to habits, create online clustering algorithms to match people to their ideal support group, serve millions of users with many terabytes of data, and tackle many difficult challenges every day. Because we are small dev team (17 strong), working at Noom gives you the unique opportunity to both use what we have created and build many more foundational technologies. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have worked hard to build an awesome company culture, stealing a bit from Google (many of us are ex-Googlers) and improving on it to become one of Crain&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Best Places to Work in NYC 2013&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our tech team works with a ton of interesting Noomers and advisers, including our in-house psychologist as well as fitness experts, physicians and researchers. &amp;nbsp;We test our prototypes on sample users, averaging 2 user-tests a day, so you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to see how real people react to your work and iterate. &amp;nbsp;So unlike most tech companies, you&amp;rsquo;ll interact with a diverse network of people. &amp;nbsp;After all, we are team of problem solvers, always interested in learning and growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re worried about being pigeonholed, fear not. &amp;nbsp;You&amp;rsquo;ll get to choose a mission (usually for 4 - 6 months) and work on the projects you&amp;rsquo;re interested in. We also have frequent company-wide hackathons. Everyone on the team is a generalist -- we explore new frameworks, and learn them quickly. We like to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are now ready to double the size of our engineering team with some incredible engineers (read on below!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noom, Inc. is a mobile solutions company focused on preventative health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noom's research-backed products help people achieve real, positive outcomes. Noom was awarded a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and was also recently selected as one of seven healthcare startups chosen to participate in the 2014&amp;nbsp;New York Digital Health Accelerator&amp;nbsp;(NYDHA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noom's apps boast more than 32&amp;nbsp;million installs worldwide and its flagship app&amp;nbsp;Noom Coach&amp;nbsp;for Android has been the #1 top grossing Health and Fitness App since 2012 in the Google Play Store. Noom has offices in New York City, Berlin, Seoul and Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we need your help -- read on if you think you&amp;rsquo;ve got the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Noom we tackle some of the world&amp;rsquo;s biggest problems -- obesity, diabetes and heart disease. &amp;nbsp;We believe the best way to do this is by focusing on nutrition (TechCrunch) and fitness (GigaOm). &amp;nbsp;More than just counting calories, our mobile software applications offer intelligent, scientifically-backed, customized nutrition- and exercise-coaching designed to impact habits and behavior. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our flagship app, Noom Weight Loss Coach, has been the #1 top grossing health &amp;amp; fitness application since 2012. &amp;nbsp;It achieves the best outcomes in the industry with over 10 pounds lost per paid member. &amp;nbsp;How, you ask? &amp;nbsp;Great question! &amp;nbsp;It has:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;* A coaching engine that generates personalized daily tasks &amp;amp; realtime motivational feedback;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The world&amp;rsquo;s most accurate food database, crowd-sourced by users &amp;amp; instantly searchable;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Virtual support groups created using automated clustering technology and tracked using scalable management tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;* A focus on simplicity and friendliness, to make all of the above easy to use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Many more features focused around guidance &amp;amp; motivation for our users&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn how a startup really works on the inside, then Noom is the place for you. We have an incredible amount of transparency, with weekly all-company TGIFs where the wine and the information both flow freely (much to our legal counsel&amp;rsquo;s dismay). &amp;nbsp;Because you&amp;rsquo;ll have equity in the company and have to make many decisions in your work, it&amp;rsquo;s important for you to know what&amp;rsquo;s going on. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have an amazing chef (we love her!) who prepares gourmet lunches every day for all employees (along with afternoon smoothies and random breakfasts and dinners), a lively office with frequent visitors, and a dedicated team who work hard and play hard, with frequent offsites (beach, anyone?) and team outings (from shuffleboard to wine tasting). &amp;nbsp;We also have more cakes than is probably healthy (welcome cakes, birthday cakes, goodbye cakes and cakes just because -- no joke).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus health insurance (100% paid by Noom) and a 401(k). We also have a $200 wellness budget, which you can spend on everything from triathlon registration fees to massages.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 01:43:41 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-09-01T01:43:41Z</a10:updated><location>New York, NY</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/94834/cto-data-scientist-w-aws-plus-financial-data-quadrant</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/94834/cto-data-scientist-w-aws-plus-financial-data-quadrant</link><a10:author><a10:name>Quadrant</a10:name></a10:author><category>amazon-web-services</category><category>mysql</category><category>python</category><category>financial</category><title>CTO - Data Scientist w/ AWS + financial data expertise at Quadrant (New York, NY)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Quadrant builds innovative tools to find, visualize, and analyze data.&amp;nbsp;We are looking for an in-house CTO + Data Scientist with strong AWS and financial data experience.

Our staff are based in cities all over the world and meet at team retreats twice per year. Avaaz covers office costs, either to establish a home office or to rent one, and we support staff to house themselves in local similar organisations when preferred.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compensation and Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Salary varies with location and experience, but is highly competitive with leading non-governmental organizations.

We&amp;rsquo;re winning -- our campaigning works and we&amp;rsquo;re changing politics and practices across the world. Check out our recent victories at http://www.avaaz.org/en/highlights.php. Or see what the world&amp;rsquo;s media is saying about us at http://www.avaaz.org/en/media.php.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Our tactics are bold and effective -- we do what&amp;rsquo;s needed to win campaigns, whether it&amp;rsquo;s pioneering the use of satellite phones and critical technology to support democracy movements or rallying the largest climate protests in history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. The mission is the metric -- large funders don&amp;rsquo;t control our strategy. We work with members to do what&amp;rsquo;s best for the world each and every time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. We thrive in risky situations -- we don&amp;rsquo;t let powerful forces like Rupert Murdoch&amp;rsquo;s media empire bully us with legal, brand or financial threats. We&amp;rsquo;re experts at navigating risk and meeting threats head on, in the media, the courts or on the streets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. We pay sustainable salaries -- our salaries are competitive and we believe in supporting long term commitment to the work we do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;6. Our team is awesome -- it&amp;rsquo;s chock full of brilliant people at the top of their fields in law, politics, civil society and more. We&amp;rsquo;re no drama and a heck of a lot of fun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;7. We have great work-life balance -- it&amp;rsquo;s a professional responsibility and there&amp;rsquo;s huge support to nail it. We believe we all work best when we are rested and enjoying a full life outside of the office.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;8. You can be anywhere -- except for a few roles that require a specific location, our staff can be based anywhere with an airport and a great internet connection. If you want to work from one of our large offices in New York or London, you can do that, or live on an island somewhere!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;9. We&amp;rsquo;re fiercely meritocratic -- our hierarchy is based on judgment and we are constantly checking it against objective standards that are 100% transparent. We believe in the best ideas becoming instantly recognized and adopted, and all jobs and roles are assigned meritocratically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;10. There&amp;rsquo;s no drama -- we work as one team to change the world. You may need to see it to believe it, but we&amp;rsquo;ve got a team where gossip, drama, internal politics and all that draining stuff just doesn't exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2015 15:43:41 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-08-30T15:43:41Z</a10:updated><location>New York, NY</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/91612/senior-front-end-developer-healthcarecom</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/91612/senior-front-end-developer-healthcarecom</link><a10:author><a10:name>HealthCare.com</a10:name></a10:author><category>.net</category><category>angularjs</category><category>c#</category><category>javascript</category><category>node.js</category><title>Senior Front-End Developer at HealthCare.com (New York, NY)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;HealthCare.com (corporate name is Healthcare, Inc.) is comprised of an experienced team of entrepreneurs, engineers, online marketers, product developers, data scientists and healthcare experts.

He/she may be asked to test code sets, document software, and implement products and related solutions. Strong knowledge of design patterns and software development best practices must be shown at all times. A high degree of creativity and motivation is required of the successful candidate, who is expected to operate with limited direct supervision. This developer needs to have a willingness to do whatever it takes to make the products and the company successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO WORK FOR NAVIS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;NAVIS was a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;finalist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2015 Oregon Tech Awards Technology Company of the Year &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;in the Growth category!-&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.navisblog.com/navis-finalist-in-the-15-oregon-tech-awards-technology-company-of-the-year-growth/%C2%A0" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.navisblog.com/navis-finalist-in-the-15-oregon-tech-awards-technology-company-of-the-year&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;NAVIS is growing fast due to high market demand for our products.

You have fixed a bug in a de-serialisation method that was causing metadata to leak from JSON objects. Considering the large amount of simultaneous, relatively small requests these services process, Node.js seemed the obvious choice. So you had to abandon your usual work field of PHP and give the old Javascript another chance. Once again it proved itself a powerful language, capable of building beautiful stuff. Maybe the front-enders were right after all? Now that this has been tackled, you return to PHP. You had this idea to optimise the determination of the sorting order of the filters on the site...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;You will be working in a team with three to five other developers, each of them with their own specialization, ranging from PHP to Javascript.

Were you the kid that took apart the family TV not just to see how it worked but because you thought you could make it better? Can you detect and prevent the invasion of bugs better than the Orkin man? &amp;nbsp;If you answered yes to any/all of these, then you really need to be a Software Development Engineer in Test at Rackspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the largest OpenStack public cloud in the business and our commitment to provide our customers the best platform to continue changing the world, the life of an SDET at the Rack can be quite unique and rewarding. How is this possible? Easy&amp;mdash;we help match your passions, birthday wishes, and Sherlock skills with the right opportunity to be GREAT. Here&amp;rsquo;s a preview to get you started:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing the Limits of the Cloud:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;OpenStack&amp;hellip;heard of it? Yep we worked with NASA as founders so of course we have some of the most notable upstream contributors on the planet. Whether for our public or private cloud offerings, our Devs are pounding out code in Python, Ruby, Java or whatever&amp;rsquo;s the next big thing at a break-neck pace. So when it comes to SDETs, we take pride in being true partners in excellence; not some robot or second-tier Dev whose only task is to cross off test cases from a checklist. Our SDETs have a tinker&amp;rsquo;s mind with a natural curiosity to know where we are going and to anticipate the unexpected. Diversity drives innovation so our teams are dispersed across the globe&amp;mdash;even working from their favorite Cheetos-stained gaming chair at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal Innovation:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Ten data centers around the globe with several hundred thousand servers that all need to seamlessly interact like one of your LAN parties back in college. If you like HUGE environments then jump on into this playground. Our DevOps Engineers, Software Developers, and Infrastructure Engineers have to keep up with the demands of the industry that didn&amp;rsquo;t exist, oh maybe 5 minutes ago. &amp;nbsp;Our SDETs who partner with these teams are literally building their dreams to insure what&amp;rsquo;s new today is built to withstand the strains of tomorrow. Bulletproof code&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s how we roll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is NOT your uncle&amp;rsquo;s Quality Engineering team where there was a lack of software development to accomplish testing and the job was just about manual button pushing. Are you ready to change the game doing what they said can&amp;rsquo;t be done? Are you ready to automate bigger things better and faster? What are you waiting for? Click that apply button, talk with one of our talent specialists and get ready to jump on in to the best adventure you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still not convinced? Hear from the Rackers who do this day in and day out but still can&amp;rsquo;t believe this is their job. &lt;a title="QE at the Rack" href="http://youtu.be/LhoEa7Ag8Xw"&gt;QE at the Rack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Aug 2015 04:43:41 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-08-29T04:43:41Z</a10:updated><location>Windcrest, TX</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/81817/perl-developer-bookingcom</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/81817/perl-developer-bookingcom</link><a10:author><a10:name>Booking.com</a10:name></a10:author><category>perl</category><category>unix</category><category>open-source</category><category>puppet</category><category>memcached</category><title>Perl Developer at Booking.com (Amsterdam, Netherlands)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Booking.com BV (the company behind Booking.com&amp;trade;, the market leading online hotel reservation service in the world) is looking for Perl Developer who is passionate about their craft, who thrives on challenge and who believes in success through collaboration.

IB handles close to 250 million post events per day. Our usage has grown considerably over the past few years, requiring that we maintain a sophisticated UI and a state-of-the-art distributed architecture which can scale to the most extreme load without compromising performance. We also build a unified multimedia communications product called BConnect. We work with open source software and encourage interaction with the wider technology community by contributing changes and taking part in related meetups and conferences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bloomberg Vault&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bloomberg Vault (BVault) is a startup within Bloomberg developing a cloud-based compliance archiving service, eDiscovery tools and real-time compliance monitoring infrastructure. The explosive growth of social media and web collaboration require businesses to remain compliant with an increasingly regulatory environment. Our software, hosted in Bloomberg's private cloud, archives over 60 billion messages and has gained rapid market adoption with over 700 enterprises. Our infrastructure processes over 200 million messages a day, checking content and interaction patterns, and providing analytics and event-driven reporting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Bloomberg Mail (Message) group builds a cloud-based platform used for Internet email, bond announcements and pricing, financial research distribution and other communication on the Bloomberg terminal. Our network of users, connected through the platform, relies on our real-time performance, ironclad security and tight integration with financial data and Bloomberg applications. Message is built on top of open source, commercial and proprietary technologies. This highly available distributed system includes comprehensive storage, search infrastructures, real-time email transport and delivery pipelines. We build APIs for integration with other applications and systems, and a feature-rich user interface optimized for our customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;News&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The News group develops one of the most heavily used applications on the Bloomberg terminal that provides search, real-time alerts and analysis. We build systems that process over one million news stories a day from over 80,000 sources. We provide scalable products that meet strict indexing latency requirements and synthesize and present an overwhelming amount of unstructured information to our clients. Bloomberg News uses our systems and workflows making them the fastest, most influential news agency in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Government Intelligence group helps investors quantify the impact of government activities such as legislation, regulation and contracting. Our work includes ingesting large unstructured public data sets and discovering actionable data points to alert clients in real-time. We design scalable search and database solutions to aid discoverability and analysis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charts and Custom Indices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Charts and Custom Indices group builds visuals that make it easier to absorb information and identify data trends. In addition to visualizations, we develop analytical platforms that retrieve, aggregate and process large data sets. Our services run on dedicated Linux servers and require stability, scalability and speed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search and Discoverability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Search and Discoverability group builds a federated search and question-answering engine to ensure Bloomberg clients can find the right information as quickly as possible. We use open source search technologies and natural language query understanding to build an intuitive search functionality. Our platform searches millions of data points from dozens of structured and unstructured data stores and natural language question-answering engines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Data Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Financial Data Infrastructure group builds the next generation of infrastructure to take in large amounts of financial data. We use big data and cluster management technologies to achieve high performance, reliability and transparency. Current initiatives include: price history infrastructure to store and manage billions of historical time series data points; data pipeline to ensure transparent and accurate delivery and governance of data; data snapshot for real time access to thousands of data points about millions of securities; and, Bloomberg Query Language to provide a rich access and calculation layer on top of all Bloomberg data.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2015 14:43:41 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-08-18T14:43:41Z</a10:updated><location>New York, NY</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/96894/system-software-engineer-contract-ivenix</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/96894/system-software-engineer-contract-ivenix</link><a10:author><a10:name>Ivenix</a10:name></a10:author><category>linux</category><category>matlab</category><category>stateflow</category><category>c</category><category>sysadmin</category><title>System Software Engineer - Contract at Ivenix (Amesbury, MA)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want to put your fingerprint on something that will help bring medical care to the state of the art.

We&amp;rsquo;re a small team of 3 passionate full-stack developers. We frequently seek out advice from each other and believe in continuous learning. We&amp;rsquo;re incredibly focused on results and don&amp;rsquo;t expect specific, regular hours in the office (we have a pretty sweet office though). Although sometimes we pair program, we aren&amp;rsquo;t religious about it. We believe process should be extracted from things that are working well. We aren&amp;rsquo;t philosophically against formal scrum sprints and stand-ups, but have found our team to work well without them so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Values:&lt;br&gt;Several months back, we sat down as an engineering team to decide on what our team values are that drive our decisions. The following are a few of these values to give a taste of what we believe as the Tuft &amp;amp; Needle engineering team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;- End-to-end ownership: Each project gets an Engineering owner that is responsible for the success of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Launch early and iterate: Done is better than perfect. Although we maintain a minimum standard of quality, we believe in getting value out of features and enhancements as soon as possible, while rapidly iterating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Do things that don&amp;rsquo;t scale: We believe that our software should automate existing manual processes to save time, rather than preempt potential needs to avoid building unnecessary software. Our litmus test for deciding on new features is &amp;ldquo;Has the team done this manually first?&amp;rdquo;. Of course, we&amp;rsquo;re pragmatic even about this value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Pragmatism: In a growing startup, our philosophy is that it&amp;rsquo;s important to be pragmatic.

Do you love 8tracks but think the product could be even better? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8tracks is the best place for people who care about music to create and consume playlists. Its crowd curated platform offers unprecedented depth and relevancy in a "lean back" fashion -- spanning every imaginable style, activity or mood -- and an unmatched opportunity for music discovery, with less repetition and a uniquely human touch. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8tracks ranks #3 in the US among internet radio listeners aged 18-34 (after Pandora and iHeartRadio) and reaches 8m MAU who stream 30m hours/month.

We&amp;rsquo;re going to ask you to build a bridge, and you&amp;rsquo;ll get it built, no matter what. You&amp;rsquo;ll balance technical requirements with business needs, while advocating for a high quality codebase when working with full business teams. You&amp;rsquo;re fluent in &amp;lsquo;technical&amp;rsquo; language and &amp;lsquo;business&amp;rsquo; language, because you&amp;rsquo;re the engineer everyone counts on to understand how it works now, how it should work, and how it will work. And through all this, you&amp;rsquo;ll make sure our younger team members develop to be amazing engineers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2015 17:43:41 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-09-14T17:43:41Z</a10:updated><location>Chicago, IL</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/82347/software-engineer-research-java-grammatech-inc</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/82347/software-engineer-research-java-grammatech-inc</link><a10:author><a10:name>GrammaTech, Inc.</a10:name></a10:author><category>c</category><category>c++</category><category>java</category><category>javascript</category><category>python</category><title>Software Engineer - Research (Java) at GrammaTech, Inc.

In addition, we build the core systems that form the foundation of applications built by other software groups within Bloomberg.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have a deep understanding of our product areas and work closely with our business counterparts and UX design teams to deliver the experience desired by our customers. As the speed of change is rapid we need people who are agile and eager to learn and develop new skills. The ability to collaborate across multiple teams and learn a depth and breadth of technical and domain knowledge is critical.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;We frequently work with open source software and encourage interaction with the wider technology community by contributing changes and taking part in related meet-ups and conferences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teams in Communication, News, and Realtime Applications and Services:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bloomberg Chat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bloomberg Chat is Bloomberg's instant messaging system.

In the last 12 months, we developed a brand new interface, which we continue to evolve. Our focus this year is our backend systems as we work on improving performance and scalability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Notes - Notes is an exciting new product being developed to further improve the collaboration capabilities of the Bloomberg system.

You should know javascript and some javascript libraries like jQuery, D3, etc, and have an interest in data visualization, data science, and internet technologies.

The position will have the opportunity to evolve into a role in which the person has an equity-stake in the company. The right person will be excited about the dynamic and fast-paced (aka stressful) environment of a startup and view that as a benefit, not a drawback. The startup environment is not for everyone, but for the person who is looking for that sort of life experience, the opportunity to help build something from the ground up where individual contributions make immediate and substantial impacts on the company as a whole can be extremely rewarding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Those interested can find out more about the company, and view some demo videos of our software in actionon our website: www.exaptive.com.
