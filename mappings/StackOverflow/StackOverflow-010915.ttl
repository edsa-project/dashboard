We are now expanding our Oklahoma City team.&nbsp;<br> <br> We are looking for an experience security architect that has designed scaleable and secure web application, and is also comfortable performing penetration testing and security analysis of systems.&nbsp;<br> <br> Some of the challenges of designing the Exaptive platform is that its goal is to be extended by third-party components, and those components will be bought and sold in a component store much like the Apple app store. This opens up opportunities for malicious code as well as introducing the complexity of financial transaction processing. On top of that, Exaptive frequently gets used for data science in fields that have confidential and proprietary data. So we're looking for someone with experience designing architectures that can deal with these things - someone with experience designing sandbox systems for large-scale multi-user environments, with financial transaction processsing applications, and with designing systems with secure data handling.&nbsp;<br> <br> This position will be based in downtown OKC, but with the opportunity for travel to Exaptive's Boston and Vancouver locations. The position will have the opportunity to evolve into a role in which the person has an equity-stake in the company. The right person will be excited about the dynamic and fast-paced (aka stressful) environment of a startup and view that as a benefit, not a drawback. The startup environment is not for everyone, but for the person who is looking for that sort of life experience, the opportunity to help build something from the ground up where individual contributions make immediate and substantial impacts on the company as a whole can be extremely rewarding.&nbsp;<br> <br> Those interested can find out more about the company, and view some demo videos of our software in actionon our website: www.exaptive.com. We were featured on the front page of the Business Innovation section of The Boston Globe (http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2013/12/cambridge-based_exaptive_wants.html) and in Oklahoma City's The Journal Record (http://www.i2e.org/news/innovators-exaptive-inc/). Our Founder and CEO, Dave King, has been invited internationally to present our work. You can see a video of a presentation he recently gave to the Oklahoma Venture Forum about Exaptive's big-picture vision on our website.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>If you don't currently live in Oklahoma City, you should check out what this up-and-coming city has to offer: a burgeoning tech startup and creative sector, the largest food truck event in the nation, olympic rowing facilities, and a cost of living that can't be beat. For the right candidate we'll pay relocation costs.</p>" ;

Exaptive is more than just a data analytics platform. It's a complete ecosystem for data science - that means it is comprised of a bunch of different pieces that all have to work together. There is the web-based development environment, the Xap Store, and the Cognitive Network. Each component introduces its own set of infrastructure requirements. In addition, we have a consulting branch of the business which sometimes needs infrastructure design decisions in response to unique custom client requirements.&nbsp;<br> <br> This position will be based in downtown OKC, but with the opportunity for travel to Exaptive's Boston and Vancouver locations. The position will have the opportunity to evolve into a role in which the person has an equity-stake in the company. The right person will be excited about the dynamic and fast-paced (aka stressful) environment of a startup and view that as a benefit, not a drawback. The startup environment is not for everyone, but for the person who is looking for that sort of life experience, the opportunity to help build something from the ground up where individual contributions make immediate and substantial impacts on the company as a whole can be extremely rewarding.&nbsp;<br> <br> Those interested can find out more about the company, and view some demo videos of our software in actionon our website: www.exaptive.com. We were featured on the front page of the Business Innovation section of The Boston Globe (http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2013/12/cambridge-based_exaptive_wants.html) and in Oklahoma City's The Journal Record (http://www.i2e.org/news/innovators-exaptive-inc/). Our Founder and CEO, Dave King, has been invited internationally to present our work. You can see a video of a presentation he recently gave to the Oklahoma Venture Forum about Exaptive's big-picture vision on our website.&nbsp;<br> <br> If you don't currently live in Oklahoma City, you should check out what this up-and-coming city has to offer: a burgeoning tech startup and creative sector, the largest food truck event in the nation, olympic rowing facilities, and a cost of living that can't be beat.

You have fixed a bug in a de-serialisation method that was causing metadata to leak from JSON objects. Considering the large amount of simultaneous, relatively small requests these services process, Node.js seemed the obvious choice. So you had to abandon your usual work field of PHP and give the old Javascript another chance. Once again it proved itself a powerful language, capable of building beautiful stuff. Maybe the front-enders were right after all? Now that this has been tackled, you return to PHP. You had this idea to optimise the determination of the sorting order of the filters on the site...</p><br /><p><strong>Team<br></strong>You will be working in a team with three to five other developers, each of them with their own specialization, ranging from PHP to Javascript. Your team will be complemented by a Scrum Master and a Product Owner.</p>" ;

We also develop analytics and visualizations of economic data to help users better understand the underpinnings of our financial system.<br><br><strong>Equity</strong><br><br>The Equity group's product is used by over 100,000 financial professionals worldwide to make investment decisions aimed at increasing alpha. This functionality is among the most used across the Bloomberg terminal and is invaluable to clients. The product allows for clear understanding of vast global data sets spanning 30+ years, big data analytics, real-time alerting and complex financial data. We build applications for discovering and analyzing market trends, aggregating and evaluating analyst predictions, and screening and back-testing investment ideas. The group is made up of fast-paced teams passionate about time-to-market, performance and visual design.<br><br><strong>Fixed Income Core</strong><br><br>The Fixed Income Core group develops software to support analytics and data that move global fixed income markets. We cover government, corporate, money market, municipal and preferred instruments.

This is one of the most widely used functions on the Bloomberg Terminal. It serves timely, accurate and market moving news to our customers by sifting through hundreds of millions of news stories. Our customers can search, analyze and set alerts for the news that matters to them in milliseconds. Developers work on scalable, low-latency solutions by making use of search and information retrieval technologies, and working with distributed systems running on dedicated farms of machines.</span><br><br><span>Realtime Applications</span><br><br><span>Alerts - The Alert product lets market participants monitor the markets. It exposes nearly every tick in the world, along with a broad range of non-pricing data from corporate actions to social media sentiment and even power station outages. The system is available 24/7 and is used by tens of thousands of traders and investors helping them respond quickly to changing market conditions. Alerts are a major strategic focus for the company and we are scaling our infrastructure and extending our feature set significantly.</span><br><br><span>Monitors - The Monitors team is responsible for providing industry-leading, comprehensive, fully custom cross-asset quote sheet applications. 200,000 of our clients rely on these applications every day.

<http://www.edsa-project.eu/jobs/StackOverflow/384> ns2:description "<p>Keen IO is seeking engineers to join our Platform team. We build and nurture an Analytics API that processes user data and queries around the clock, across diverse industries. Whether it&rsquo;s gaming, e-commerce, advertising, publishing, or IoT, our platform aims to make Analytics so easy for developers that they can focus entirely on their product. Every day, every week, every month our challenge is to scale with a constantly growing data deluge and evolve along with our user&rsquo;s needs.</p><br /><p>About the Platform Team</p><br /><p>We work together in a pretty novel fashion - servant leaders are elected from the team, by the team. Responsibilities normally held by a single manager are separated across multiple roles. We have very open discussions about our shared priorities.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re always iterating on how we work and what we build. We&rsquo;re growing fast and we know that what worked a year ago won&rsquo;t necessarily work a year from now. This applies both to the technology and the organizations of our teams. We want to provide the best analytics experience for developers and co-create the best work environment for each other - willingness to evolve is essential.</p><br /><p>About the Job</p><br /><p>By centralizing a data pipeline for hundreds of companies, we operate at a scale that none of them have to worry about. Looking to the horizon, we need to look at every piece of our infrastructure with a critical eye. We need to stay ahead of the curve. You will help us be thoughtful and deliberate about tackling the right bottlenecks at the right time. You&rsquo;ll help make working on the platform easier and easier. You&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to gain deep understanding of distributed systems and teach others! Most importantly, you&rsquo;ll collaborate with some pretty amazing humans.</p>" ;

Our front-end engineers love what they do, and they are on a mission to continuously improve upon and build the most beautiful and useful user interfaces the open data world has ever seen.</p><br /><p><strong>About You</strong><br>Creative.

You&rsquo;re tickled by the idea of implementing inventive uses of older technologies, but even more revved at the idea of leveraging the most modern front-end tools, frameworks, and languages.

The right programmer for this position will be fluent in Javascript as well as a number of other languages. While they might be comfortable using framework libraries, they'll be the type of programmer that actually understands how the framework works, when it's appropriate, and when it's preferable to build thier own functionality directly. The right programmer for this position will *love* abstraction, strive for elegance, and will enjoy thinking about recursion until their brain hurts.&nbsp;<br> <br> This position will be based in downtown OKC, but with the opportunity for travel to Exaptive's Boston and Vancouver locations. The position will have the opportunity to evolve into a role in which the person has an equity-stake in the company. The right person will be excited about the dynamic and fast-paced (aka stressful) environment of a startup and view that as a benefit, not a drawback. The startup environment is not for everyone, but for the person who is looking for that sort of life experience, the opportunity to help build something from the ground up where individual contributions make immediate and substantial impacts on the company as a whole can be extremely rewarding.&nbsp;<br> <br> Those interested can find out more about the company, and view some demo videos of our software in actionon our website: www.exaptive.com. We were featured on the front page of the Business Innovation section of The Boston Globe (http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2013/12/cambridge-based_exaptive_wants.html) and in Oklahoma City's The Journal Record (http://www.i2e.org/news/innovators-exaptive-inc/).

<http://www.edsa-project.eu/jobs/StackOverflow/566> ns2:description "<p><strong>You</strong></p><br /><p>Noom is looking for an awesome Software Engineer who's&nbsp;a true team player and passionate about engineering, with tons of programming&nbsp;experience (doesn't matter if it was at Apple or in your mom&rsquo;s basement) and excellent communication skills. A CS background or degree usually helps a lot, but is not a strict requirement if you really know your stuff.</p><br /><p><strong>Our Tech</strong></p><br /><p>At our core, we are a team of great engineers from world-class companies, so we take our tech very seriously. We work to improve our tools and approaches every day -- whether pushing the envelope with automated unit-tests or writing a super-optimized data analysis framework. We don't over-engineer and also don't under-engineer -- just the right tool for the job.</p><br /><p>We take great pride in our code because we all want to innovate quickly. We build everything from Android software to C++ image recognition, from web UI to pedometer data analysis. Our apps operate off-line, and we have built lots of client-side infrastructure to lazily load and sync data with the server. This allows us to keep the server side relatively simple while still serving millions of users: Spring/Flask, Spring MVC, mySQL/Mongo.</p><br /><p>We run Hadoop-based machine learning to find out what makes people stick to habits, create online clustering algorithms to match people to their ideal support group, serve millions of users with many terabytes of data, and tackle many difficult challenges every day. Because we are small dev team (17 strong), working at Noom gives you the unique opportunity to both use what we have created and build many more foundational technologies. &nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Our Culture</strong></p><br /><p>We have worked hard to build an awesome company culture, stealing a bit from Google (many of us are ex-Googlers) and improving on it to become one of Crain&rsquo;s &ldquo;Best Places to Work in NYC 2013&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our tech team works with a ton of interesting Noomers and advisers, including our in-house psychologist as well as fitness experts, physicians and researchers. &nbsp;We test our prototypes on sample users, averaging 2 user-tests a day, so you&rsquo;ll be able to see how real people react to your work and iterate. &nbsp;So unlike most tech companies, you&rsquo;ll interact with a diverse network of people. &nbsp;After all, we are team of problem solvers, always interested in learning and growing.</p><br /><p>If you&rsquo;re worried about being pigeonholed, fear not. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get to choose a mission (usually for 4 - 6 months) and work on the projects you&rsquo;re interested in. We also have frequent company-wide hackathons. Everyone on the team is a generalist -- we explore new frameworks, and learn them quickly. We like to learn.</p><br /><p>We are now ready to double the size of our engineering team with some incredible engineers (read on below!).</p><br /><p><strong>Our Company</strong></p><br /><p>Noom, Inc. is a mobile solutions company focused on preventative health.</p><br /><p>Noom's research-backed products help people achieve real, positive outcomes. Noom was awarded a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and was also recently selected as one of seven healthcare startups chosen to participate in the 2014&nbsp;New York Digital Health Accelerator&nbsp;(NYDHA).</p><br /><p>Noom's apps boast more than 32&nbsp;million installs worldwide and its flagship app&nbsp;Noom Coach&nbsp;for Android has been the #1 top grossing Health and Fitness App since 2012 in the Google Play Store. Noom has offices in New York City, Berlin, Seoul and Tokyo.</p><br /><p>But we need your help -- read on if you think you&rsquo;ve got the stuff.</p><br /><p><strong>Our Products</strong></p><br /><p>At Noom we tackle some of the world&rsquo;s biggest problems -- obesity, diabetes and heart disease. &nbsp;We believe the best way to do this is by focusing on nutrition (TechCrunch) and fitness (GigaOm). &nbsp;More than just counting calories, our mobile software applications offer intelligent, scientifically-backed, customized nutrition- and exercise-coaching designed to impact habits and behavior. &nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our flagship app, Noom Weight Loss Coach, has been the #1 top grossing health &amp; fitness application since 2012. &nbsp;It achieves the best outcomes in the industry with over 10 pounds lost per paid member. &nbsp;How, you ask? &nbsp;Great question! &nbsp;It has:</p><br /><p>* A coaching engine that generates personalized daily tasks &amp; realtime motivational feedback;</p><br /><p>* The world&rsquo;s most accurate food database, crowd-sourced by users &amp; instantly searchable;</p><br /><p>* Virtual support groups created using automated clustering technology and tracked using scalable management tools.</p><br /><p>* A focus on simplicity and friendliness, to make all of the above easy to use</p><br /><p>* Many more features focused around guidance &amp; motivation for our users</p><br /><p><strong>Our Benefits</strong></p><br /><p>If you want to learn how a startup really works on the inside, then Noom is the place for you. We have an incredible amount of transparency, with weekly all-company TGIFs where the wine and the information both flow freely (much to our legal counsel&rsquo;s dismay). &nbsp;Because you&rsquo;ll have equity in the company and have to make many decisions in your work, it&rsquo;s important for you to know what&rsquo;s going on. &nbsp;</p><br /><p>We have an amazing chef (we love her!) who prepares gourmet lunches every day for all employees (along with afternoon smoothies and random breakfasts and dinners), a lively office with frequent visitors, and a dedicated team who work hard and play hard, with frequent offsites (beach, anyone?) and team outings (from shuffleboard to wine tasting). &nbsp;We also have more cakes than is probably healthy (welcome cakes, birthday cakes, goodbye cakes and cakes just because -- no joke).</p><br /><p>Plus health insurance (100% paid by Noom) and a 401(k). We also have a $200 wellness budget, which you can spend on everything from triathlon registration fees to massages.</p>" ;

We are now expanding our Oklahoma City team.&nbsp;<br> <br> We are looking for entry-level programmers that have some formal computer science training, but are just starting their careers. You should know javascript and some javascript libraries like jQuery, D3, etc, and have an interest in data visualization, data science, and internet technologies. Most importantly, you should be hungry to build big, important applications that matter, and looking for projects to flex your newly developed coding muscles on.&nbsp;<br> <br> Experience with a variety of different internet technologies would be a bonus, but not necessary - we view this very much as a learn-on-the-job type position and as a result are valuing smarts, motivation and desire-to-learn over experience. These positions will be based in downtown OKC, but with the opportunity for travel to Exaptive's Boston and Vancouver locations. The position will have the opportunity to evolve into a role in which the person has an equity-stake in the company. The right person will be excited about the dynamic and fast-paced (aka stressful) environment of a startup and view that as a benefit, not a drawback. The startup environment is not for everyone, but for the person who is looking for that sort of life experience, the opportunity to help build something from the ground up where individual contributions make immediate and substantial impacts on the company as a whole can be extremely rewarding.&nbsp;<br> <br> Those interested can find out more about the company, and view some demo videos of our software in actionon our website: www.exaptive.com. We were featured on the front page of the Business Innovation section of The Boston Globe (http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2013/12/cambridge-based_exaptive_wants.html) and in Oklahoma City's The Journal Record (http://www.i2e.org/news/innovators-exaptive-inc/). Our Founder and CEO, Dave King, has been invited internationally to present our work. You can see a video of a presentation he recently gave to the Oklahoma Venture Forum about Exaptive's big-picture vision on our website.&nbsp;<br> <br> If you don't currently live in Oklahoma City, you should check out what this up-and-coming city has to offer: a burgeoning tech startup and creative sector, the largest food truck event in the nation, olympic rowing facilities, and a cost of living that can't be beat.

Our staff are based in cities all over the world and meet at team retreats twice per year. Avaaz covers office costs, either to establish a home office or to rent one, and we support staff to house themselves in local similar organisations when preferred.</span></p><br /><br /><strong>Compensation and Benefits:</strong><p><br /><span>Salary varies with location and experience, but is highly competitive with leading non-governmental organizations. Benefits also range with location, but include 5 weeks paid vacation per year.</span></p><br /><p><span><span><br><br></span></span></p><br /><strong>10 more reasons to join Avaaz!</strong><p><br /><p><span>1. We&rsquo;re winning -- our campaigning works and we&rsquo;re changing politics and practices across the world. Check out our recent victories at http://www.avaaz.org/en/highlights.php. Or see what the world&rsquo;s media is saying about us at http://www.avaaz.org/en/media.php.</span></p><br /><p><span>2. Our tactics are bold and effective -- we do what&rsquo;s needed to win campaigns, whether it&rsquo;s pioneering the use of satellite phones and critical technology to support democracy movements or rallying the largest climate protests in history.</span></p><br /><p><span>3. The mission is the metric -- large funders don&rsquo;t control our strategy. We work with members to do what&rsquo;s best for the world each and every time.</span></p><br /><p><span>4. We thrive in risky situations -- we don&rsquo;t let powerful forces like Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s media empire bully us with legal, brand or financial threats. We&rsquo;re experts at navigating risk and meeting threats head on, in the media, the courts or on the streets.</span></p><br /><p><span>5. We pay sustainable salaries -- our salaries are competitive and we believe in supporting long term commitment to the work we do.</span></p><br /><p><span>6. Our team is awesome -- it&rsquo;s chock full of brilliant people at the top of their fields in law, politics, civil society and more. We&rsquo;re no drama and a heck of a lot of fun.</span></p><br /><p><span>7. We have great work-life balance -- it&rsquo;s a professional responsibility and there&rsquo;s huge support to nail it. We believe we all work best when we are rested and enjoying a full life outside of the office.</span></p><br /><p><span>8. You can be anywhere -- except for a few roles that require a specific location, our staff can be based anywhere with an airport and a great internet connection. If you want to work from one of our large offices in New York or London, you can do that, or live on an island somewhere!</span></p><br /><p><span>9. We&rsquo;re fiercely meritocratic -- our hierarchy is based on judgment and we are constantly checking it against objective standards that are 100% transparent. We believe in the best ideas becoming instantly recognized and adopted, and all jobs and roles are assigned meritocratically.</span></p><br /><p><span>10. There&rsquo;s no drama -- we work as one team to change the world. You may need to see it to believe it, but we&rsquo;ve got a team where gossip, drama, internal politics and all that draining stuff just doesn't exist.</span></p><br /><p>" ;

We are collaborative, empathetic, and pragmatic, and it&rsquo;s important that this internal culture scales with us as we grow. </span></p><br /><p>The Qapital backend systems are structured in large part according to the Microservices pattern, and expose a RESTful HTTP API to our client apps. The core services are all developed in house, while we integrate with multiple external platform providers for more low-level banking infrastructure services.</p><br /><p>Can you code confidently at all levels of the back-end stack? We want to meet you. Do you also have ideas outside the usual conventions, and frequently come up with new ideas for building applications? Then we really want to meet you.</p><br /><p><strong>How we work</strong></p><br /><p><span>At Qapital every developer is a part of the entire lifetime of a new feature. From the initial idea, forming the hypothesis of how it will improve the experience to developing it and finally following up on the results as it is released.</span></p><br /><p><span>We work in short iterations to get new features out to users as quickly as possible. We typically focus the entire team, from designers to backend and frontend developers on one feature because we think that with teamwork comes great innovation and knowledge sharing.</span></p><br /><p><span>We are all eager to learn and develop and we believe in a culture where sharing experiences and giving feedback comes natural.</span></p><br /><p><span>A diverse team is best positioned to truly serve our market, and diverse applicants bring ideas, abilities and perspectives that we haven&rsquo;t even considered yet. We especially encourage you to apply if you are part of a category or group that is normally underrepresented in the tech industry.</span></p>" ;

Here's what we do...</strong><br>Alliants are a bunch of people who care about building the right thing, and building things right. All of our work comes from recommendation, which is why we don&rsquo;t have a sales team. Whether we're building a new startup, growing a large product, coaching in dev processes, designing new tech strategies, or refactoring a large old behemoth, each interaction we have has created more work for us.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re based in London and Southampton, so if you like the bustle, varied culture and tiny apartments; or instead like the sea, paddle-boarding to work and smell of farms we can accommodate you.</p><br /><p><strong>What were looking for</strong><br>A company based on recommendation needs people who have pride in what they do. You understand how good design helps mature a system, and have probably read Martin Fowler or Uncle Bob on well designed clean code, you like to keep abreast of what you don&rsquo;t know or use, like new languages like Elixir or Rust. You appreciate the professionalism that TDD (or good tests) affords. You know the trade offs of monolithic architectures and that newer ways, like micro-services, have trade offs too. And ultimately you know that there is no universal correct way of building software.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re a knowledge based business - people come to us because we know what to do and how to do it. So we don&rsquo;t hire people to just write programs. We need people who help us build our own knowledge, and do things better. We&rsquo;re not afraid to prototype and give talks on our ideas, and encourage all to do the same.</p><br /><p>Although technical competency is important, we want people passionate about software. We think that passion is visible in our work. We&rsquo;re looking for people of all levels, grads to senior developers.</p><br /><p><strong>How we work</strong><br>We almost always try to be highly agile, goal/data driven, and collaborative. Our clients may not be. But even then our consultants and coaches are on hand to help them change to a more innovative way of working.</p><br /><p>We predominantly use Rails for web and iOS and Android for mobile. But we're always interesting in other technologies like Node.js, Angular.js, Go.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We like good work/life balance, limits to bureaucracy, and to letting people figure things out themselves. We have standards if you want to use them, but teams are empowered to ignore or improve on them as their work demands.</p><br /><p><strong>That sounds great! <em>What else?</em></strong><br>We have all the usual things like healthcare, life insurance, pensions, parties, conference &amp; training budgets, your choice of hardware, beer fridges.&nbsp;But why not tell us what you want from your work life and see if we fit with each other.</p>" ;

<http://www.edsa-project.eu/jobs/StackOverflow/872> ns2:description "<p><strong>Over MultiDAM</strong></p><br /><p>REPRO/MultiDAM heeft de ambitie dat alle ambulances altijd op het juiste moment op de juiste locatie aanwezig zijn. De reden is simpel. In levensbedreigende noodsituaties waar iedere seconde telt, is het een enorme uitdaging voor ambulancedienstverleners om binnen enkele minuten op de plaats van bestemming te arriveren en direct te beginnen met het verlenen van de eerste hulp. In Nederland wordt gewerkt met een richtlijn dat 95% van alle levensbedreigende noodsituaties binnen 15 minuten worden bereikt door een ambulance. In de praktijk blijkt dat deze doelstelling structureel niet wordt gehaald door het merendeel van de ambulance dienstverleners. In 7% van de ruim 500.000 levensbedreigende noodritten wordt de aanrijtijd overschreden, wat als gevolg heeft dat in 35.000 gevallen de ambulance te laat arriveert.</p><br /><p>Ons concept is een software-oplossing die ervoor zorgt dat de reactietijd van ambulances verkort kan worden door middel van verschillende Dynamisch Ambulance Management (DAM) algoritmen die ontwikkeld worden door CWI. De gemeenschappelijke deler van deze algoritmen is dat we proactief ambulances binnen hun regio gaan verplaatsen zodat we altijd de optimale dekking van het gebied realiseren.</p><br /><p>Wat kunnen meldkamers en de ambulancedienstverleners bereiken met REPRO/MultiDAM:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>vermindering van de tijd die besteed wordt aan logistieke besluitvorming door de centralist;</li><br /><li>verhoging van de beschikbare tijd voor medische ondersteuning door de centralist;</li><br /><li>elimineren van irrationele menselijke besluitvorming op de inzet van ambulances;</li><br /><li>reductie van de rijtijdoverschrijding;</li><br /><li>gerichte lokale verbetering van de prestaties van bijvoorbeeld 80% naar 85% voor een specifiek postcode gebied;</li><br /><li>een reductie van de kosten door effici&euml;ntere distributie van ambulances;</li><br /><li>optimaliseren van standplaatslocaties om kosten te reduceren.</li><br /></ul><br /><br /><p>Voor de juiste persoon is dit de ideale kans om ervaring op te doen bij een startend bedrijf en onderdeel uitmaken van een ondernemend team. Wij bieden je een uitdagende functie aan in een dynamisch start-up met een no-nonsense mentaliteit, waar flexibiliteit, teamwork en een informele sfeer belangrijke uitgangspunten zijn.</p><br /><p>Je werkt zowel op CWI in Amsterdam als op locatie in de gemeenschappelijke meldkamer van Politie, Brandweer en Ambulance in Lelystad. Je werkt op het snijvlak van techniek, wiskunde en klantcontact. Je zorgt ervoor dat onze oplossing naar een hoger plan wordt getild en helpt hierbij meer ambulances tijdig bij de pati&euml;nt te laten zijn. In levensbedreigende noodsituaties telt namelijk iedere seconde.</p><br /><p>In dit project zul je intensief samenwerken met onderzoekers van CWI, de ambulancemeldkamer van de Flevoland, onze toekomstige klanten en onze partner NLC (<a href=\"http://www.nlc.nl/\" rel=\"nofollow\" rel=\"nofollow\" rel=\"nofollow\" rel=\"nofollow\" rel=\"nofollow\" rel=\"nofollow\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nlc.nl</a>).</p><br /><p>Als programmeur ben je grotendeels bezig met het verbeteren en ontwikkelen van onze realtime DAM-software. Je bent een belangrijke brug tussen onze gebruikers op locatie en onze software ontwikkeling. Je luistert naar de problemen die de gebruikers ondervinden en vertaalt deze naar de technische vraag of een software-probleem. Je gebruikt je creatief probleemoplossend vermogen en technische expertise om onze organisatie te ondersteunen daar waar diepgaande technische kennis nodig is.

The higher salary you request, the better we expect you to be.</p><br /><p><strong>Job Perks</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Competitive Pay</li><br /><li>Unlimited Vacation</li><br /><li>401k with 4% company matching&nbsp;</li><br /><li>100% of employees individual health care paid</li><br /><li>Flexible schedule</li><br /><li>Access to the latest fitness devices (power meters, trainers, sensors, etc.)</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Your Resume Should have...</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Examples of C# projects you have worked on</li><br /><li>Links to any open source projects you've contributed to</li><br /><li>Github/StackOverflow username if you'd like</li><br /><li>Examples of experience in the \"Optional Technology Experience\" area</li><br /><li>Links to any sample C# code that you're proud of</li><br /><li>Your required annual salary</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>We also Require...</strong></p><br /><p>The best engineers only want to work with other great engineers. We've found that the best way to find great engineers is to actually have them code, not just answer trivia questions during an interview.</p><br /><p>That's why we require applications to do a refactoring exercise as part of their job submission. The right candidate&nbsp;won't find this a pain in the ass; it should be enjoyable.</p><br /><p>This also weeds out the vast majority of candidates&nbsp;who just fire off resumes everywhere. In our previous job posting, 90% of candidates&nbsp;did NOT do this step.</p><br /><p>The refactoring exercise is attached to this job posting. It has a readme.txt in it with instructions.</p><br /><p><strong>Excited about our Company?</strong></p><br /><p>In your application let us know why you want to work with us and why you think you'd be a good fit for our company.</p><br /><p><strong>FAQs</strong></p><br /><p><strong><em>Do I have to be a cyclist to apply?</em></strong></p><br /><p>Nope! We'll encourage you to ride, and will even buy you an entry level bike if you want, but it's not required. Not everyone in the company is a cyclist.</p><br /><p><strong><em>What's unlimited vacation mean?</em></strong></p><br /><p>We don't keep track of vacation hours. The CEO of TrainerRoad used to be an engineer at a Fortune 500 company where life was a grind. We believe employees put out their best work when they are happy and not burnt out.</p><br /><p>If you're brain just isn't working at 3pm, we encourage employees to go home and rest up. It does no one any good to sit and stare at the computer screen for another two hours. We don't track that time.</p><br /><p>Employees generally shoot for around four weeks of REAL vacation time (no e-mail checking) but some take more and some take less. &nbsp;The thing we care about is how productive you can be and how much value you can add to the company. Bottom line, we want people who are passionate and get things done. If you meet those requirements everything else works itself out.</p><br /><p>That being said, if you end up taking massive amounts of vacation, come in late, leave early and aren't producing outstanding work we're going to have a problem.</p><br /><p><strong><em>How do you work?</em></strong></p><br /><p>We try to work as pragmaticly as we can. &nbsp;We have excellent designers on staff who go from mockups to responsive HTML with light javascript work.</p><br /><p>Development uses Github with a strict&nbsp;pull request process. We test, comment, refactor and improve each other's pull requests.</p><br /><p>We have partial test coverage and we can definitely improve in that area (maybe you can help?).</p><br /><p>We often pair program via Screen Hero.</p><br /><p>Our developers float between mobile, desktop and web development. Our future engineers can specialize&nbsp;in one area if that's where their passion is.</p><br /><p><strong><em>You didn't ask about education, what's required?</em></strong></p><br /><p>Please put your education on your resume, but we're not going to reject someone because they don't have a degree in Computer Science. We understand that some of the best and most passionate&nbsp;engineers are self taught.</p><br /><p><strong><em>This is the longest job posting ever, when does it end?</em></strong></p><br /><p>Right now! Congrats if you made it this far! We look forward to looking at your resume and refactoring exercise.&nbsp;</p>" ;
