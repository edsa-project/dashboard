A CS background or degree usually helps a lot, but is not a strict requirement if you really know your stuff.</p><br /><p><strong>Our Tech</strong></p><br /><p>At our core, we are a team of great engineers from world-class companies, so we take our tech very seriously. We work to improve our tools and approaches every day -- whether pushing the envelope with automated unit-tests or writing a super-optimized data analysis framework. We don't over-engineer and also don't under-engineer -- just the right tool for the job.</p><br /><p>We take great pride in our code because we all want to innovate quickly. We build everything from Android software to C++ image recognition, from web UI to pedometer data analysis. Our apps operate off-line, and we have built lots of client-side infrastructure to lazily load and sync data with the server. This allows us to keep the server side relatively simple while still serving millions of users: Spring/Flask, Spring MVC, mySQL/Mongo.</p><br /><p>We run Hadoop-based machine learning to find out what makes people stick to habits, create online clustering algorithms to match people to their ideal support group, serve millions of users with many terabytes of data, and tackle many difficult challenges every day. Because we are small dev team (17 strong), working at Noom gives you the unique opportunity to both use what we have created and build many more foundational technologies. &nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Our Culture</strong></p><br /><p>We have worked hard to build an awesome company culture, stealing a bit from Google (many of us are ex-Googlers) and improving on it to become one of Crain&rsquo;s &ldquo;Best Places to Work in NYC 2013&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our tech team works with a ton of interesting Noomers and advisers, including our in-house psychologist as well as fitness experts, physicians and researchers. &nbsp;We test our prototypes on sample users, averaging 2 user-tests a day, so you&rsquo;ll be able to see how real people react to your work and iterate. &nbsp;So unlike most tech companies, you&rsquo;ll interact with a diverse network of people. &nbsp;After all, we are team of problem solvers, always interested in learning and growing.</p><br /><p>If you&rsquo;re worried about being pigeonholed, fear not. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get to choose a mission (usually for 4 - 6 months) and work on the projects you&rsquo;re interested in. We also have frequent company-wide hackathons. Everyone on the team is a generalist -- we explore new frameworks, and learn them quickly. We like to learn.</p><br /><p>We are now ready to double the size of our engineering team with some incredible engineers (read on below!).</p><br /><p><strong>Our Company</strong></p><br /><p>Noom, Inc. is a mobile solutions company focused on preventative health.</p><br /><p>Noom's research-backed products help people achieve real, positive outcomes. Noom was awarded a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and was also recently selected as one of seven healthcare startups chosen to participate in the 2014&nbsp;New York Digital Health Accelerator&nbsp;(NYDHA).</p><br /><p>Noom's apps boast more than 32&nbsp;million installs worldwide and its flagship app&nbsp;Noom Coach&nbsp;for Android has been the #1 top grossing Health and Fitness App since 2012 in the Google Play Store. Noom has offices in New York City, Berlin, Seoul and Tokyo.</p><br /><p>But we need your help -- read on if you think you&rsquo;ve got the stuff.</p><br /><p><strong>Our Products</strong></p><br /><p>At Noom we tackle some of the world&rsquo;s biggest problems -- obesity, diabetes and heart disease. &nbsp;We believe the best way to do this is by focusing on nutrition (TechCrunch) and fitness (GigaOm). &nbsp;More than just counting calories, our mobile software applications offer intelligent, scientifically-backed, customized nutrition- and exercise-coaching designed to impact habits and behavior. &nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our flagship app, Noom Weight Loss Coach, has been the #1 top grossing health &amp; fitness application since 2012. &nbsp;It achieves the best outcomes in the industry with over 10 pounds lost per paid member. &nbsp;How, you ask? &nbsp;Great question! &nbsp;It has:</p><br /><p>* A coaching engine that generates personalized daily tasks &amp; realtime motivational feedback;</p><br /><p>* The world&rsquo;s most accurate food database, crowd-sourced by users &amp; instantly searchable;</p><br /><p>* Virtual support groups created using automated clustering technology and tracked using scalable management tools.</p><br /><p>* A focus on simplicity and friendliness, to make all of the above easy to use</p><br /><p>* Many more features focused around guidance &amp; motivation for our users</p><br /><p><strong>Our Benefits</strong></p><br /><p>If you want to learn how a startup really works on the inside, then Noom is the place for you. We have an incredible amount of transparency, with weekly all-company TGIFs where the wine and the information both flow freely (much to our legal counsel&rsquo;s dismay). &nbsp;Because you&rsquo;ll have equity in the company and have to make many decisions in your work, it&rsquo;s important for you to know what&rsquo;s going on. &nbsp;</p><br /><p>We have an amazing chef (we love her!) who prepares gourmet lunches every day for all employees (along with afternoon smoothies and random breakfasts and dinners), a lively office with frequent visitors, and a dedicated team who work hard and play hard, with frequent offsites (beach, anyone?) and team outings (from shuffleboard to wine tasting). &nbsp;We also have more cakes than is probably healthy (welcome cakes, birthday cakes, goodbye cakes and cakes just because -- no joke).</p><br /><p>Plus health insurance (100% paid by Noom) and a 401(k). We also have a $200 wellness budget, which you can spend on everything from triathlon registration fees to massages.</p>|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|

Here's what we do...</strong><br>Alliants are a bunch of people who care about building the right thing, and building things right. All of our work comes from recommendation, which is why we don&rsquo;t have a sales team. Whether we're building a new startup, growing a large product, coaching in dev processes, designing new tech strategies, or refactoring a large old behemoth, each interaction we have has created more work for us.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re based in London and Southampton, so if you like the bustle, varied culture and tiny apartments; or instead like the sea, paddle-boarding to work and smell of farms we can accommodate you.</p><br /><p><strong>What were looking for</strong><br>A company based on recommendation needs people who have pride in what they do. You understand how good design helps mature a system, and have probably read Martin Fowler or Uncle Bob on well designed clean code, you like to keep abreast of what you don&rsquo;t know or use, like new languages like Elixir or Rust. You appreciate the professionalism that TDD (or good tests) affords. You know the trade offs of monolithic architectures and that newer ways, like micro-services, have trade offs too. And ultimately you know that there is no universal correct way of building software.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re a knowledge based business - people come to us because we know what to do and how to do it. So we don&rsquo;t hire people to just write programs. We need people who help us build our own knowledge, and do things better. We&rsquo;re not afraid to prototype and give talks on our ideas, and encourage all to do the same.</p><br /><p>Although technical competency is important, we want people passionate about software. We think that passion is visible in our work. We&rsquo;re looking for people of all levels, grads to senior developers.</p><br /><p><strong>How we work</strong><br>We almost always try to be highly agile, goal/data driven, and collaborative. Our clients may not be. But even then our consultants and coaches are on hand to help them change to a more innovative way of working.</p><br /><p>We predominantly use Rails for web and iOS and Android for mobile. But we're always interesting in other technologies like Node.js, Angular.js, Go.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We like good work/life balance, limits to bureaucracy, and to letting people figure things out themselves. We have standards if you want to use them, but teams are empowered to ignore or improve on them as their work demands.</p><br /><p><strong>That sounds great! <em>What else?</em></strong><br>We have all the usual things like healthcare, life insurance, pensions, parties, conference &amp; training budgets, your choice of hardware, beer fridges.&nbsp;But why not tell us what you want from your work life and see if we fit with each other.</p>|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|

You will need to have a BS/BA/IT Degree or equivalent experience with 2+ years of experience managing and deploying process updates and integration services to/on an ERP platform. Your colleagues describe you as a go-to person for challenges around technical integrations architecture, dealing with complex data structure patterns. If you have hands on experience with REST, Web Services, XML, XSLT and working knowledge of scripting languages (Perl/Python/Php/Unix Shell) and ANSI/SQL, then that's a big plus.

You should have an intermediate to advanced understanding of the Gang of Four design patterns and how to apply them to software development. The ideal candidate&nbsp;is a "developer's developer" and enjoys reading about programming in their free time, tinkering on the weekends with side projects and staying abreast of the latest frameworks/technologies in their area of expertise.</p><br /><p>We basically want someone with a passion for development.</p><br /><p><strong>Required Technology Experience</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>C# Experience - Intermediate to Advanced&nbsp;proficiency</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Optional Technology Experience</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>ASP.net MVC</li><br /><li>LINQ</li><br /><li>Web API</li><br /><li>Azure</li><br /><li>Xamarin</li><br /><li>SQL</li><br /><li>ReactiveUI</li><br /><li>WPF</li><br /><li>Javascript Frameworks (Angular,&nbsp;React, ect)</li><br /><li>HTML</li><br /><li>Build/Test CI&nbsp;</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Work Remote or in Reno, Nevada</strong></p><br /><p>We're looking for the best candidate&nbsp;<em>worldwide</em>. Don't let a little thing like geography get in the way. One&nbsp;third of our team currently&nbsp;works remotely. It works very well with the help of Slack, Screen Hero,&nbsp;Basecamp, and Github.</p><br /><p>We do require you to be able to make our 1pm pacific time standup and have at least a four hour overlap with our 8-5pm mon-fri Reno office hours at least four days a week.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>For example, we have an Australian employee who works from noon to 9pm pacific time Sunday through Thursday&nbsp;(that's his mon-fri). That works just fine for us.</p><br /><p><strong>Job&nbsp;Salary</strong></p><br /><p>Let us know what you want to get paid when you submit your resume.&nbsp;We want experienced and proficient&nbsp;engineers. The higher salary you request, the better we expect you to be.</p><br /><p><strong>Job Perks</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Competitive Pay</li><br /><li>Unlimited Vacation</li><br /><li>401k with 4% company matching&nbsp;</li><br /><li>100% of employees individual health care paid</li><br /><li>Flexible schedule</li><br /><li>Access to the latest fitness devices (power meters, trainers, sensors, etc.)</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Your Resume Should have...</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Examples of C# projects you have worked on</li><br /><li>Links to any open source projects you've contributed to</li><br /><li>Github/StackOverflow username if you'd like</li><br /><li>Examples of experience in the "Optional Technology Experience" area</li><br /><li>Links to any sample C# code that you're proud of</li><br /><li>Your required annual salary</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>We also Require...</strong></p><br /><p>The best engineers only want to work with other great engineers. We've found that the best way to find great engineers is to actually have them code, not just answer trivia questions during an interview.</p><br /><p>That's why we require applications to do a refactoring exercise as part of their job submission. The right candidate&nbsp;won't find this a pain in the ass; it should be enjoyable.</p><br /><p>This also weeds out the vast majority of candidates&nbsp;who just fire off resumes everywhere. In our previous job posting, 90% of candidates&nbsp;did NOT do this step.</p><br /><p>The refactoring exercise is attached to this job posting. It has a readme.txt in it with instructions.</p><br /><p><strong>Excited about our Company?</strong></p><br /><p>In your application let us know why you want to work with us and why you think you'd be a good fit for our company.</p><br /><p><strong>FAQs</strong></p><br /><p><strong><em>Do I have to be a cyclist to apply?</em></strong></p><br /><p>Nope! We'll encourage you to ride, and will even buy you an entry level bike if you want, but it's not required. Not everyone in the company is a cyclist.</p><br /><p><strong><em>What's unlimited vacation mean?</em></strong></p><br /><p>We don't keep track of vacation hours. The CEO of TrainerRoad used to be an engineer at a Fortune 500 company where life was a grind. We believe employees put out their best work when they are happy and not burnt out.</p><br /><p>If you're brain just isn't working at 3pm, we encourage employees to go home and rest up. It does no one any good to sit and stare at the computer screen for another two hours. We don't track that time.</p><br /><p>Employees generally shoot for around four weeks of REAL vacation time (no e-mail checking) but some take more and some take less. &nbsp;The thing we care about is how productive you can be and how much value you can add to the company. Bottom line, we want people who are passionate and get things done. If you meet those requirements everything else works itself out.</p><br /><p>That being said, if you end up taking massive amounts of vacation, come in late, leave early and aren't producing outstanding work we're going to have a problem.</p><br /><p><strong><em>How do you work?</em></strong></p><br /><p>We try to work as pragmaticly as we can. &nbsp;We have excellent designers on staff who go from mockups to responsive HTML with light javascript work.</p><br /><p>Development uses Github with a strict&nbsp;pull request process. We test, comment, refactor and improve each other's pull requests.</p><br /><p>We have partial test coverage and we can definitely improve in that area (maybe you can help?).</p><br /><p>We often pair program via Screen Hero.</p><br /><p>Our developers float between mobile, desktop and web development. Our future engineers can specialize&nbsp;in one area if that's where their passion is.</p><br /><p><strong><em>You didn't ask about education, what's required?</em></strong></p><br /><p>Please put your education on your resume, but we're not going to reject someone because they don't have a degree in Computer Science. We understand that some of the best and most passionate&nbsp;engineers are self taught.</p><br /><p><strong><em>This is the longest job posting ever, when does it end?</em></strong></p><br /><p>Right now! Congrats if you made it this far! We look forward to looking at your resume and refactoring exercise.&nbsp;</p>|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|
